On Thursday, September 9, in the settlements of Bana and Baku, located in the west of the African country of Cameroon, an unusual meteorological phenomenon was observed for this region - snow fell there. The thickness of the cover has reached several centimeters. According to the mayor of the city, the snowfall is related to climate change. He added that on Thursday, snow and hail damaged the roofs of houses, blocked the movement of public transport, plantations of the future harvest also suffered. In turn, the Minister of Justice of Cameroon called the snow a "curse" that "will destroy agriculture - the main source of income for the population." At this time, the Cameroonians were extremely surprised to see snow on their streets and actively shared photos and videos of the unusual phenomenon on social networks. In 2021, natural disasters have become more frequent. We are seeing climate change in many countries around the world. It is not known how 2021 will end. #weather #news #earthquake #tsunami #Africa #rain #Cameroon #snow #flood #fire #hailstorm #hail #hurricane #nature #disasters snow,snow fall,snow falling,snow fall in Cameroon,snow fall in the western region of Cameroon,Cameroon,Cameroon snow fall,causes of snow fall,what is snow fall,side effect of snow,benefits of snow,nunu gist,snow fall 2021, flood,storm,heavy rain,climate change,weather,live news,flash flood,flooding,bbc news,news,hailstorm,hurricane,natural disasters,tornado,breaking news,disaster,snow,tsunami,latest news,thunderstorm,thunder,earth,earthquake,fox news,ida,hurricane ida,lightning,rain,wind,abc news,nature,fire,forest fire,afghanistan,taliban,top,france 24,euronews,sky news,nbc nightly news,world news,hail,ice,notice,Africa,africa,Cameroon,snow in Africa,climate,heat,trip,top 10,UK ===================================================== SUBSCRIBE Our Channel :https://bit.ly/3dwEGgl ===================================================== ⚠️ Some of the footages used in this channel do not belong to us, the copyright belong to respective footage owner mentioned in the upper left of the video.

Yet it is also a seedbed for the human activities that cause global warming. One question keeps popping up in the center of all this: Do Asians care about climate change? To help me answer this question, I invited a couple of Asians: my good friend and fellow millennial - Rob @robchanau, the best boomer in town - Bill @btung64, and the unstoppable gen-Z and upcoming sustainable leader - Toby @imtobyy.

With rising awareness of wildfires worldwide and the release of the IPCC report on Climate Change, and upcoming COP26 in Glasgow and UN Biodiversity Convention in China, the topic is timely. This webinar focuses on new understanding of climate-induced wildfires, their effects on soil biodiversity and ecosystem processes, and identifying research priorities for the future. Moderator Richard Bardgett (University of Manchester, UK) and panelists Lizzie Wandrag (University of York, UK), Konstantin Gongalsky (Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia), Marie-Charlotte Nilsson (Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Sweden) and Mac Callaham (US Forest Service, USA), discuss their research, major gaps in knowledge, and how soil biodiversity research under global changes informs future land use policy. * Note: The recording started a few moments into Dr. Diana Wall's introduction. Apologies for the abrupt start. Please enjoy the rest of the webinar.		22	People & Blogs	PT1H29M45S	1785	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iUTrUYG_lNQ/maxresdefault.jpg		22	0	0	0	2

Today, the impacts of climate change are felt more strongly around the world, including more intense floods, droughts, and wildfires. Seeing these disasters and their aftermath, it seems unimaginable to bring back what is already gone. Listen to Supriya Prasannan, Head of Legal for Ericsson Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, share our vision of a world where connectivity improves lives and pioneers a sustainable future. Just as our Connected Mangroves project. An initiative that uses IoT technology for reforestation, supporting the Sabak Bernam community in Selangor, Malaysia to protect the area against natural disasters and restore their livelihoods. Thanks to IoT possibilities and the engagement from locals, universities, NGOs and research institutes, the site has since come back from a barren field to a lush and thriving mangrove forest. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of many, the United Nations gave Ericsson their ‘Momentum for Change’ award in 2016 in celebration of the positive changes that have taken place for the Sabak Bernam community and their revitalized Mangroves.

CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS — Geneticists led by Harvard Medical School's George Church are seeking to bring the woolly mammoth back to life 4,000 years after its extinction, and have secured $15 million of investment, according to CNN. Supporters of the idea believe their return to the Arctic could help recreate a grazing ecosystem, trampling down and compacting snow, which makes it less likely to melt and release methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, according to the BBC. Supporters also speculate that because ‘mammoths are like walking bulldozers’ they could be used to level forests and shrublands that have sprung up in the Arctic, which would mean sunlight-reflecting snow remains in those areas longer.

Does Joe Biden's recent vaccine mandate play into the World Economic Forum's initiative to "reset" capitalism? What about all the other things he's done that put our nation last? In other geopolitical issues, Biden's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan has only served to empower our enemies like China and Russia. Back at home, AOC went to the Met Gala in a dress that read, without a shred of irony, "tax the rich." Haskins explains why she's actually getting played by the system she thinks she's fighting against. --- Today's Sponsors: Chamonix's Genucel serum with plant stem cell technology helps get rid of those bags & puffiness under your eyes.

Fertile lands are turning into deserts in the north, while flash floods have become more common in the south. Nigeria's oil industry is making the situation worse, as the practice of flaring - the burning of natural gas that is released when oil is extracted - is common, despite being illegal. It is a major source of greenhouse gases and a contributor to climate change. BBC Life at 50C investigates how extreme heat is affecting lives across the world.

Joe Manchin, the key swing vote. Schumer (D-NY) said Monday that the Democrats are doing “everything” they can to help Biden meet his goal of curbing US carbon emissions 50 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. “The bottom line for all of us is: We can’t let this moment pass us by,” Schumer said at an event hosted by the environmental groups League of Conservation Voters and Climate Power, Politico reported. “The Senate will act in a way that’s commensurate with the magnitude of the climate crisis,” he said. But the bill — which, along with funds to fight climate change, also contains a raft of other spending on health care, family leave and education — has Manchin and some other Democrats balking at the price tag. #ChuckSchumer #JoeManchin #GovernmentSpending The New York Post is your source for breaking news, news about New York, sports, business, entertainment, opinion, real estate, culture, fashion, and more.

In fact, climate change is taking priority over other important issues that Canadians care about. For example, during the English Leaders' Debate, a significant chunk of the debate was spent on climate change and how each political leader was determined to meet its aspirational Paris climate targets.

Climate change has had a devastating impact on Nigeria. Fertile lands are turning into deserts in the north, while flash floods have become more common in the south. The country's oil industry is making things worse as the practice of flaring - the burning of natural gas that is released when oil is extracted from the ground - is common despite its illegality. The practice is a major source of greenhouse gases and a contributor to climate change.

Yet, people still feel disconnected from the issue. Parents are especially concerned because their children will be the most impacted by climate change’s consequences, but they don’t feel confident talking about the issue and they don’t understand how to help. Science Moms is a group of nonpartisan climate scientists and mothers who have dedicated their lives to solving the problem and are now reaching out to other parents for reinforcement. Their emotional campaign aims to connect with mothers of all political persuasions about what’s at stake for their children and how together, mothers can be the force that finally ushers in an era of solutions.

Svalbard is a landscape of jagged mountains, fjords, glacier and polar bears but it is changing fast. Temperatures in the arctic have warmed at around twice the global average. New figures given exclusively to GMB show that since 1970 the average winter temperature in Svalbard has increased by 7.7 degrees from -15.9 to -8.2. Nowhere on the planet is heating up this fast. The Norwegian Polar Institute says that because of rising temperatures, within 20 - 40 years, the arctic ocean is likely to be ice-free in the summer, the ice will melt much earlier in the spring and freezing will take place later in the autumn. This will have devastating consequences for the people of Svalbard; the animals here including polar bear and reindeer and will impact the rest of the world too.

"We in the west are cutting our emissions, which costs us money, costs us jobs," Mr Bolt said. "We're getting rid of our coal-fired power stations and our power prices are going up because green energy isn't cheap. "China though, is not cutting emissions, it's actually increasing them. "China is actually building more and more coal-fired power stations, more than we're knocking down." Mr Bolt also said western companies, "whose factories do need cheap power, are moving their factories to China". "And that is one reason why Europe's emissions from industrial processes is falling." Mr Bolt spoke to energy economist Alan Moran about the issue.	6272291699001,andrewbolt,fb,msn,opinion,yt	25	News & Politics	PT7M34S	454	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pX49Wl2QyfE/maxresdefault.jpg	1	10541	563	26	0	238

On Thursday, September 9, in the settlements of Bana and Baku, located in the west of the African country of Cameroon, an unusual meteorological phenomenon was observed for this region - snow fell there. The thickness of the cover has reached several centimeters. According to the mayor of the city, the snowfall is related to climate change. He added that on Thursday, snow and hail damaged the roofs of houses, blocked the movement of public transport, plantations of the future harvest also suffered. In turn, the Minister of Justice of Cameroon called the snow a "curse" that "will destroy agriculture - the main source of income for the population." At this time, the Cameroonians were extremely surprised to see snow on their streets and actively shared photos and videos of the unusual phenomenon on social networks. In 2021, natural disasters have become more frequent. We are seeing climate change in many countries around the world.

The rise in prices can have serious consequences for the most vulnerable Americans. According to the USDA, 13.8 million Americans qualified as food insecure in 2020. Watch the video to find out how much food prices have risen, what's driving the increase and how businesses and policymakers can fix it. The Biden administration said Wednesday it plans to take “bold action” to enforce antitrust laws aimed at meatpacking companies it says are causing beef, pork, and poultry prices to rise at the grocery store. Even though beef prices have been rising, farmers and ranchers have been making less money, the White House said. Climate change, labor issues, transportation concerns and other supply chain disruptions have been contributing to the rising costs over the past several years. The pandemic disruptions then sped up the rate of growth in prices. These price increases have significant consequences for the most vulnerable Americans. The United States Department of Agriculture reported Wednesday that 13.8 million households were considered food insecure in 2020. The Biden administration last month increased assistance for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. Previously known as Food Stamps, the benefits were increased by more than 25%. “It’s a combination of all these factors,” SuperMarketGuru.com editor Phil Lempert said. “It’s very difficult to say what did the pandemic do? What does climate change do? What is transportation do? So we’ve got to lump it all together. And we’ve got to solve them all together.” 0:00 - Introduction 01:31 - Rising costs 03:41 - Climate change 04:44 - Supply chain issues 08:33 - Health impact 11:55 - Solutions » Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision » Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic About CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

Get access to extended, ad-free OCC content with CuriosityStream AND Nebula for $14.79 per year (26% off for a limited time only!) https://curiositystream.com/occ In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why these tipping points are code red for our planet and how the climate crisis and capitalism are driving us closer to the edge. Specifically, I look at climate tipping points like the Amazon rainforest dieback and the melting of the permafrost in order to grasp what exactly is at stake if we don't act now on climate change and the climate crisis. The Amazon rainforest dieback tipping point is currently being driven by Amazon rainforest deforestation and climate change-driven extreme heat. and wildfires. If left unchecked, climate change and deforestation could mean an irreversible die-off of the Amazon rainforest. Another tipping point of consequence is the melting of the permafrost. Permafrost melt creates a positive feedback look and could potentially release hundreds of billions of tons of CO2 and methane into the air, further warming the climate. Tipping points then show us that action needs to be taken right now or else irreversible consequences will soon arrive.

Billions of unassuming rocks on the seafloor could help humanity save itself from the ravages of climate change. These polymetallic nodules contain cobalt and other metals which we need for batteries, electric cars and photovoltaic systems. But harvesting them might destroy deep-sea ecosystems. Special thanks to GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel https://www.geomar.de/en/ We're destroying our environment at an alarming rate. But it doesn't need to be this way. Our new channel Planet A explores the shift towards an eco-friendly world — and challenges our ideas about what dealing with climate change means. We look at the big and the small: What we can do and how the system needs to change. Every Friday we'll take a truly global look at how to get us out of this mess. #PlanetA #ClimateChange #DeepSeaMining READ MORE: Map showing the location of the three main marine mineral deposits: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-world-map-showing-the-location-of-the-three-main-marine-mineral-deposits_fig5_322364992 UN International Seabed Authority Publications: https://www.isa.org.jm/publications ISA Exploration Contracts: https://www.isa.org.jm/exploration-contracts/polymetallic-nodules GEOMAR Mining Impact Publications: https://miningimpact.geomar.de/publications The abyssal food-web model indicates faunal carbon flow recovery and impaired microbial loop 26 years after a sediment disturbance experiment: https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=uO2btYoAAAAJ&citation_for_view=uO2btYoAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC Artisanal Mining, Livelihoods, and Child Labor in the Cobalt Supply Chain of the Democratic Republic of Congo: http://cega.berkeley.edu/assets/cega_research_projects/179/CEGA_Report_v2.pdf Deutsche Rohstoffagentur Rohstoffinformationen (German only) https://www.deutsche-rohstoffagentur.de/DE/Gemeinsames/Produkte/Downloads/DERA_Rohstoffinformationen/rohstoffinformationen-36.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2 00:00 - 00:55 Intro 00:55- 01:48 Metals and Resources 01:48 - 03:40 What are polymetallic nodules 03:40 - 06:11 Research and exploration 06:11 – 08:30 Impact on deep sea ecosystems 08:30 – 09:16 Alternatives to deep sea mining Reporter: Lydia Meyer Video Editor: Henning Goll Supervising Editor: Kiyo Dörrer, Joanna Gottschalk ► Check out our channel trailer: https://youtu.be/T8EiTHe6eXg ► Want to see more?

Jackson Proskow explains how climate change played a role in this disaster, and what that means for the future. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney's popularity has plummeted as COVID-19 cases rise in the province. What could that mean for the federal Conservatives ahead of the election? Tom Vernon reports. As the world begins transitioning from fossil fuels to combat climate change, jobs in the oil and gas industry will continue to decrease. Heather Yourex-West explains what a "just transition" would look like in Canada, and why the idea is easier said than done. You may have noticed an increase in "help wanted" signs. Despite a rise in unemployment during the pandemic, Canadian employers are struggling to find workers. Anne Gaviola looks at the employment paradox. Plus, Eric Sorensen looks into the pressure on the federal government to stop exporting coal, and how burning the fossil fuel is hampering climate goals.

States the likes of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware have been hardest hit by Hurricane Ida with conditions not expected to ease until Friday morning local time. CNN correspondent Pete Muntean says the tropical storm has had “some very severe impacts” in the US. “This was a massive system but didn’t come with a lot of warning and some are saying this was a once in every 500-year storm,” he told Sky News Australia. “But officials are underscoring this really is the result of climate change, and the two words you’re going to start hearing in the United States: climate resilience. “Leaders in Washington want more investment in to try to make sure when this does happen, it has less of an impact on everyday lives.”	6270685204001,fb,msn,us,world,yt	25	News & Politics	PT3M5S	185	2d	hd	false		1	5724	180	452	0	932

Democrats were more likely to believe “deaths from disasters has been going up” when they have been “going down dramatically”. People affiliated with the left-leaning political party were also more likely to believe that “carbon emissions in the United States have been going up - they’ve been going down quite significantly over the past 10 years”. “It really cut against the idea that Democrats are the ones who have a monopoly of the truth on climate change and Republicans are somehow caught up in misinformation.”	6270466999001,alanjones,fb,msn,opinion,yt	25	News & Politics	PT4M15S	255	2d	hd	false		1	162301	8545	163	0	2317

According to researchers, glaciers are melting at a rate never seen before. “It’s horrific to see this almost unrecognizable from one year ago, two years ago, let alone 10-20 years ago,“ said Dr. John Pomeroy, a hydrologist and director of Global Water Futures. Pomeroy said the record-setting heat domes and wildfires this season have helped accelerate glacial melt. “It’s not impossible to imagine if we are losing ice at the rate that Peyto Glacier is losing ice this year, our rivers would run dry in August and September,” conservationist Dr. Harvey Locke said. As Jayme Doll reports, researchers say the glacial melt is another casualty of climate change.

Improve your understanding of statistics and scientific graphics with Brilliant! https://www.brilliant.org/simonclark In this video I wanted to address a common talking point - why have climate change predictions been so wrong? Year after year predictions are made that have no basis in reality, so why - especially in the aftermath of the latest IPCC report - should we trust climate scientists? In particular James Hansen and his prediction in 1988 didn't turn out so well, did it? Well, as it turns out, there's a very good reason. Because they're right most of the time, and their predictions, including those of the IPCC, have been borne out by reality. Sorry lol.

The climate emergency requires climate solutions. And fast! There are lots of different proposals floating around - some of which don't even exist yet, and probably never will. So, it's easy to get confused about which direction is best. Now though, a new analysis suggests that 90% of the job could be achieved by just a handful of disruptive technologies that are very real indeed, and are already either disrupting their markets or are poised to do so. We just need to choose to embrace them!

More than 70,000 square kilometres of marsh and forest land have burnt in the Pantanal in the last three years. This equals about 4 million football fields. The Pantanal Wetlands are located in the heart of South America and are the world’s largest tropical wetlands. Home to a wealth of biodiversity, they stretch from Brazil into Paraguay and Bolivia. Unlike the Amazon Rainforest, vegetation in the Pantanal has evolved to coexist with fire — many plant species there require the heat from fires to germinate. Often caused by lightning strikes, those natural fires spring up at the end of the dry season, but the surrounding floodplains prevent them from spreading. What’s different now is the drought, contributing further to the unusually dry conditions and exacerbating the fire risk. More than 580 species of bird, 271 of fish, 174 mammals, 131 reptiles and 57 amphibians thrive in the region’s flooded areas, grasslands, lakes and forests. Unceasing fires have killed many species or left them without homes to migrate to. The number of fires in the region has been drastically increasing with every passing year - In 2020 there were 3506 fires from January 1st to July 22, a 192% increase from 2019. In 2019-20, the region suffered the worst drought in 50 years. The Parana river which runs through Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina is undergoing its worst drought in 80 years right now, which scientists have attributed to climate change. The Pantanal wetlands supply water to the Paraguay river which in turn supplies to the Parana river that impacts an ecosystem comprising 40 million people including fishing communities, farmers and a major export hub in both Brazil and Argentina. The droughts have not only affected biodiversity but also local communities and their freshwater supply. The drought has been caused because of a phenomenon known as ‘atmospheric blocking’. An odd ‘high-pressure area’ prevented the formation of rain clouds resulting in high temperatures and low humidity. Part of the rain that falls on the Pantanal is brought by winds blowing from the North Atlantic to the Amazon. The humidity coming down from the Amazon and cold fronts coming up from the South were prevented by this high-pressure bubble. So, masses of warmer and drier air have contributed to the scarcity of rain during the summer. Burning of vegetation to clear land for cattle ranching also contributed to the spread of wildfires across the region. José Marengo, a researcher at Natural Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN) said that “Fires caused by warmer thick air and lack of rain in the Pantanal and burning of vegetation on the other hand has resulted in an environmental disaster.” The recent drought has been different from the ones in the 1950s and 1960s when the planet was cooler. Right now, these natural droughts are suffering the effects of unstable climate systems, and the effects are worse because the dense population is now more vulnerable to the impact of droughts than ever before.

Rather, the Earth itself may also be warming the massive block of Antarctic ice, which is colloquially known as the "Doomsday Glacier." According to the study, the crust beneath west Antarctica is between 10 to 15 miles or 17 to 25 kilometers thick compared with around 25 miles or 40 kilometers in the East and this means that substantially more heat from below can access the West than can access the East. The researchers found that a geothermal heat flow of up to 150 milliwatts per square meter can occur beneath Thwaites Glacier, according to the study’s lead author.

For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi The onset of the coronavirus pandemic caused unprecedented, worldwide supply-chain disruptions, but experts say that’s a drop in the bucket compared with the disruptions that climate change will cause. Wildfires in the American West, flooding in China and Europe and drought in South America are already disrupting supplies of everything from lumber to chocolate to sushi rice. “Whether you’re in the agricultural sector or the forestry sector, or in the tech sector, there is really no particular sector that is immune from climate change,” said Christy Slay, senior director of science and research applications at The Sustainability Consortium. Take, for example, lumber. About a quarter of the lumber consumed in the U.S. comes from Canada, which is seeing severe drought and wildfire conditions. “The wildfires burning in Western Canada are significantly impacting the supply chain and our ability to transport product to market,” Canadian lumber producer Canfor Corp. said in July. “As a result, we are implementing short-term production curtailments at our Canadian sawmills.” The homebuilding industry is already suffering severe supply-chain issues due to Covid, and fires are only exacerbating that. “Wildfires in the West and Canada are a challenge for lumber production. While prices have come down, the building material supply chain remains vulnerable to disruption,” said Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. Brazil is now suffering its worst drought in more than a century. That, in part, caused the price of coffee futures to soar in July, nearly double what they were the previous year. While the increase has not been passed on to the consumer yet, experts say it will be shortly. Even sushi rice is getting hit. Two-thirds of America’s is grown in California, which faces water shortages due to drought and the wildfires. Rice production involves massive quantities of water. Extreme weather events also hit supply chains when workers are unable to physically get to their jobs. Workplace disruptions caused by climate change could lead to more than $2 trillion in productivity losses by 2030, according to a recent report from the United Nations Development Program. » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision » Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC » Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

During the rainy season, more than one-fifth of the country can be flooded at once and there is very little escape from gushing waters for the 165 million population. In 2017 monsoon season, the country faced some of the worst flooding in their history. Thousands of homes and rice crops were destroyed, and families were left struggling to afford food. And the situation is expected to get worse in years to come. By 2050, nearly 13 million people are expected to be displaced due to the rise of its sea level which is projected to rise 1.5 meters. Insight journeys into the lives of some of the most ordinary people in Bangladesh to provide a micro perspective to the challenges of climate change. Can a poor country like Bangladesh withstand and cope with the worsening impact of the climate crisis? How can it ensure it leaves no one behind in its fight against climate change?

The purpose of the briefing was to provide perspective on the issue of climate change globally and the common approaches required to tackle it, with particular emphasis on the South African context. Key points addressed during the briefing included the absence of intersectionality where gender equity and urban inequality are not recognized as climate issues; the necessity of a just energy transition which is inclusive and intersectional ; and ensuring there is climate consideration in future planning. With the upcoming 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, in Glasgow, the Government of South Africa has been discussing climate change and other environmental issues, with this briefing demonstrating the apparent recognition that one of the largest investments in tackling climate change related issues is building political will amongst policymakers. There must be a climate consciousness in every plan made for the future of South Africans.		29	Nonprofits & Activism	PT1H1M5S	65	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kD3K4bkhMSY/maxresdefault.jpg		56	0	1	0	0

Mr Dean said The Australian’s Graham Lloyd was quick to point out the report “was as much a political document as a scientific one”. “From a scientific perspective, AR6 (sixth assessment report) does not draw any startling new conclusions,” Mr Lloyd reported. “Where the AR6 report becomes political is the extent to which it allows itself to become a vehicle for breathless prophecies of a looming Hadean future.”	6267986165001,fb,msn,opinion,outsiders,yt	25	News & Politics	PT5M36S	336	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4p4-7DdClrs/maxresdefault.jpg	1	59315	3404	125	0	1611

But part of that is understanding the tools and strategies countries are using to decarbonize and stabilize the climate. This is work that's already being done. We have already decoupled economic growth from the emission of greenhouse gasses which, frankly, was unthinkable just a couple decades ago. We need to be thinking and talking about this stuff, and one really important piece of that is understanding this stuff so we can talk about it and advocate for it. And, good news, it's all actually pretty fascinating!!

At the same time, Ganganagar, in west Rajasthan, reported India's highest temperature of 44.5°C. Some pockets of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, north Rajasthan and west Uttar Pradesh still continue to face heat wave conditions. This issue is now prevalent world over. But the world is not only getting hotter but also more wetter or humid. We usually consider the dry-bulb temperature to describe how hot or cold a place is. Scientists, however, have been stressing upon taking into account humidity and other factors to assess how weather conditions will affect human health and activity. Humidity is measured as wet-bulb temperature. Factoring in the humidity along with the heat, called the heat index, helps us determine what the temperature actually ‘feels like’. You may have noticed this in your mobile phones and apps as well. Humidity combined with heat is deadlier for human health and wellbeing. Currently, one phenomenon is severely testing the human tolerance of this heat-humidity balance. Climate Change! Humans with their sweat-based cooling system, have been well-designed to beat the heat. But there is a limit to the level of heat and humidity we can cope with. A wet-bulb temperature or WBT of 35°C mark is considered the maximum limit of humidity that humans can handle. Beyond this, the body can no longer effectively cool itself via perspiration.

Parts of the western US have seen record-breaking temperatures this year, which - along with severe drought conditions - have triggered a series of major wildfires. So far this year in California, more than twice as many acres of land have been burned by wildfires compared with the five-year average. Dr Susan Prichard, from the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences at the University of Washington, says: "We now have the conflagrations in California that we feared, following the record-setting heatwaves."Given that California wildfires have burned all the way into November in recent years, I'm afraid that we might be set up for another record-breaking fire season."Across the United States, more than 3.5 million acres have been burned so far this year. That's one million more than at this point in the 2020 fire season - which ended as the most destructive season on record. The acres burned across the US in 2021 so far sit below the 10-year average, with some other states not being as badly hit as California. But experts are warning it is still very early, in what is looking like an exceptionally dry and long fire season. Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires. Dr Prichard says: "Extreme fire weather events including increased lightning and strong winds, are also becoming more common under climate change."The wildfires in Turkey have been labelled 'the worst in its history' by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. More than 200 have affected western and southern Turkey, although the authorities say the majority of these are now contained. About 175,000 hectares have been burned so far this year, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. That's more than eight times the average for this time of year - measured between 2008 and 2020. Dr Yusuf Serengil, from the Faculty of Forestry at the University of Istanbul, says: "It's a very bad year all over the Mediterranean region. We believe that this is caused by an above-average hot July in the region."The Turkish authorities have been criticised for being caught off-guard by the recent fires, and not having enough planes to help tackle them. They eventually received help from France, Spain and several other nations which provided air support. Greece has also seen record-breaking wildfires - with 12 times as much land being burned than average. Much of this destruction has been caused by wildfires on the Greek island of Evia, with more than 2,000 people being evacuated by sea. Thick smoke from forest fires has blanketed parts of Siberia, and satellites have tracked it drifting to the Arctic Circle and beyond.

A sweeping new climate report by the United Nations suggests the world is on track for catastrophe and more extreme weather, as greenhouse gas emissions continue to alter the planet's climate at an alarming rate. The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) involved the work of 234 scientists, and more than 14 thousand studies. It concluded humans are primarily fueling climate change. It also shows the world has warmed by about 1.1-degree Celsius since the late 19th century, and will likely surpass the 1.5 degree mark in 20 years. Heather Yourex-West explains the grim findings, what they mean for Canadians, and what experts say is needed to avoid the worst-case scenario. Plus, Robin Gill speaks to climatologist Xuebin Zhang, one of the lead Canadian authors on the report, to explain the document's alarming findings and what humanity can do to help turn things around.

The report’s 200-plus authors distilled 14,000 individual studies to produce today’s release. Even the IPCC’s so-called “summary for policymakers,” a distillation of the report’s key findings approved by the delegations of 195 nations, clocks in at 42 pages. Here are five key takeaways from the report:Not only that but atmospheric CO₂ is now at a two million-year peak. Consuming fossil fuels has combined with agriculture to push methane and nitrous oxide—also greenhouse gases—to records for at least the last 800,000 years. All the greenhouse gases have elevated the global average temperature by about 1.1° Celsius above the late 19th century average. In fact, humans have already dumped enough greenhouse gas into the atmosphere to heat up the planet by 1.5°C—one of the goals set by the Paris Agreement—but fine-particle pollution from fossil fuels is masking it by providing a cooling effect. The combined contribution to global warming of natural factors, such as the sun and volcanoes, is now estimated to be close to zero. This hasn’t always been the case. A recently as 20 years ago, for instance, it was virtually impossible to attribute any particular storm or temperature spike to the warming world. But the climate science profession has seen entire specialties emerge and mature since the IPCC’s previous mega-report in 2013. No field is more resonant than the ability to analyze extreme weather events in real-time to determine what role climate change is playing. The deadly heat wave that gripped the western coast of North America in June had detectable evidence of human responsibility—and that determination came quickly. World Weather Attribution, an international research group, needed just days after the heat broke to conclude that the extraordinary temperatures would be “virtually impossible” without climate change. This one is a milestone in the field of climate sensitivity that’s taken four decades. Drawing from research on ancient climates, as well as advanced satellite technology that monitors clouds and emissions, new models have narrowed the projections of the atmosphere’s likely response to industrial emissions. That allowed the IPCC authors to focus their temperature projections for the rest of the century, giving humanity a clearer picture of what may lie in store if we don’t act quickly to curtail emissions. The Earth’s response to a theoretical doubling of preindustrial CO₂ levels is now thought to be between 2.5°C to 4°C—a much smaller range than 1.5°C to 4.5°C in previous IPCC reports. These findings rule out the possibility that unrestricted emissions will have only a mild effect on global temperatures, a hope very few observers of events in recent months could cling to.

Changes to the world's climate are inevitable and irreversible, and without immediate, radical action to reduce greenhouse gases the future is catastrophic.

"Climate change is a fact, it's already happening, it's no matter what not going to go away." Drawing on more than 14,000 scientific studies, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC - report sounded a dire warning: The world is dangerously close to runaway warming…and greenhouse gas levels are high enough to guarantee climate disruption for decades. Here are some of the report's main takeaways. Humans are to blame. Full stop. The first line of the report reads: ''It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land." U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres described the report as a "code red for humanity." The report describes possible futures depending on how dramatically the world cuts emissions. Even the severest of cuts are unlikely to prevent global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures. But Without immediate steep emissions cuts, average temperatures could cruise past 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century. Weather extremes once considered rare or unprecedented are becoming more common. Severe heat waves that happened only once every 50 years are now happening roughly once a decade. Tropical cyclones are getting stronger. Most land areas are seeing more rain or snow fall in a year. Severe droughts are happening 1.7 times as often. And fire seasons are getting longer and more intense. Even if global warming were halted at 1.5 degree Celsius, the average sea level would still rise about 6 to 10 feet, and maybe more. Summertime sea ice atop the Arctic Ocean will vanish entirely at least once by 2050 – and that’s the IPCC’s most optimistic scenario. The report comes just three months before COP26 - a major U.N. climate conference taking place in Glasgow. Nations will now be under even more pressure to pledge more ambitious climate action, and substantial financing to go with iT. Greenpeace UK Executive Director John Sauven says the world needs to take note of this report and act immediately.

The deadly heat waves, gargantuan hurricanes and other weather extremes that are already happening will only become more severe, the United Nations panel on climate change told the world on Monday, reporting that global warming was dangerously close to being out of control – and that humans were “unequivocally” to blame. Referring to a recent spate of extreme weather events, Thunberg said: "These are all just symptoms of the climate crisis. We're not talking about the root cause itself, the things that are actually fuelling these events. And we are not holding people in power accountable." “I hope that this can be a wake up call,” Thunberg said of the report, in an interview.

The 1.5C mark is considered to be the point where climate change becomes increasingly dangerous. The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change committed countries to limiting warming to 1.5C but they have already risen by 1.2C. Today's report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was produced by 200 scientists from 60 countries. It is the first comprehensive assessment of the science of climate change since 2013 and offers the starkest warning yet about the speed and scale of warming. It comes as record heatwaves, wildfires and floods hit countries around the world.

Humanity's damaging impact on the climate is a "statement of fact", UN scientists have found in unprecedented research combining more than 14,000 studies. The past five years have been the hottest on record since 1850. Extremes including heatwaves have become more frequent and more intense since the 1950s, while cold events have become less frequent and less severe. The authors also show that a rise in sea levels approaching 2m by the end of this century "cannot be ruled out".

Then why is it so difficult for people to understand? Or people do not want to understand, what is the state of nature. In the last few months, people have never seen such a hostile form of nature. There has been a severe drought in the western part of the United States. China and Germany are flooded. Every time a natural disaster breaks a new record. As much as water-borne natural disasters, everything has taken horrific shapes. People, houses, crop lands are all going under water. If climate change is a shark, water acts like a shark's teeth, says James P. Bruce, a researcher at the American Meteorological Society. Now the shark has come up over the sea, so we are in so much suffering. Where in the world is the impact of climate change? Environmental pollution and climate change have overtaken almost all the countries of the world, Antarctica and the Arctic. Temperatures are rising in the Arctic, the North Pole region of the world. Melting ice. A huge iceberg in the Arctic melted last week. Last week, much of the Arctic's ice-covered Greenland melted into the sea. Scientists say Greenland's ice has melted into so much water that it could cover the entire state of Florida in the United States. This is the third time since 1950 that Greenland has lost so much ice in a single day. The previous record is also of this decade. আরও বিস্তারিত জানতে ভিজিট করুন: https://www.somoynews.tv Fair Use Disclaimer: ================= This channel may use some copyrighted materials without specific authorization of the owner but contents used here falls under the “Fair Use” as described in The Copyright Act 2000 Law No. 28 of the year 2000 of Bangladesh under Chapter 6, Section 36 and Chapter 13 Section 72.

Dozens of wildfires have broken out in Greece, Italy and Turkey — forcing residents and tourists to evacuate. DW's correspondents in Turkey, Greece and Italy are on the ground following this story. 01:54 — Turkey On Turkey's southern coast, blazes have killed at least eight people. DW's Julia Hahn reports from Manavgat, one of the areas that has been badly affected by the wildfires in Turkey. 04:24 — Greece In Greece, temperatures are expected to peak at 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country this week. The prime minister says Greece is experiencing its worst heatwave since 1987. Local authorities are advising households and businesses to conserve electricity especially during afternoon and evening peak times. DW correspondent Florian Schmitz reports from Thessaloniki. 07:27 — Italy Extreme weather has emergency services on high alert in Italy, too. Heavy rain and floods have hit the north of the country, while wildfires burn in the south. The Italian fire service say they have carried out over 700 operations in the past 24 hours on wildfires burning across the central and southern parts of the country. Jacopo Lentini reports from Palermo. 09:50 — What to make of these multiple extreme weather events? DW puts the extreme heatwave in southern Europe into perspective with Mojib Latif, a meteorologist at Germany’s Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research, and author of best-selling climate change book 'Hot Times.'

The extremely severe floods that hit Germany between 12 and 15 July are unprecedented in Germany's recent history. The intensity and suddenness of the floods, which completely surprised everyone, is particularly frightening. Experts are investigating the reasons for such sudden and massive floods, and one of the possible and probable explanations is climate change. Admittedly, something is wrong with the planet. And while part of the planet is consumed by huge heat, Europe's raging and rainiest weather is the worst in 200 years.

The Royal Meteorological Society says such highs could become the new normal, regardless of whether global temperatures are limited to a rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile another group of scientists says the Arctic is now the "ground zero" of climate change, and is calling for drastic action. Sky's Climate Change Correspondent Hannah Thomas-Peter reports.

The year 2020 was the third warmest, fifth wettest and eighth sunniest on record, scientists said in the latest UK State of the Climate report. No other year is in the top 10 on all three criteria. The experts said that, in the space of 30 years, the UK has become 0.9C warmer and 6% wetter. The report's lead author Mike Kendon, climate information scientist at the UK Met Office, told BBC News: “A lot of people think climate change is in the future – but this proves the climate is already changing here in the UK.“As it continues to warm we are going to see more and more extreme weather such as heatwaves and floods.”The report says the UK has become hotter, sunnier and rainier:Scientists warn of worse extreme weather if global temperatures rise and politicians fail to curb carbon emissions. And in separate report, scientists warned that greenhouse gas levels are already too high “for a manageable future for humanity“. Liz Bentley, head of the Royal Meteorological Society, said that even if governments could achieve the challenging outcome of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C – which looks very unlikely - that would still lead to a 10% increase in the amount of water the air can hold.“In the UK,” she said, “we are likely to see temperatures of 40C. As we get 1.5C warming, that’ll be something we see on a regular basis."People don’t realise that even a small temperature rise of 0.1 or 0.2 degrees overall can make a huge difference – especially in the frequency and intensity of extreme events.“We had roads melting last year, rails start to buckle, electric cabling starts to buckle. We often say we’d like a climate like the Med, but people were soon complaining they were too hot - not just in the day but especially at night.“It often takes a massive high-impact event to change attitudes to the climate – so let’s hope what’s been happening recently with extreme weather will raise the will to tackle the problem.”The State of the Climate report also indicates that plants are responding to the changes in climate. Leaves appeared on average 10.4 days earlier than the 1999- 2019 baseline for a range of common shrub/tree species. While the signs of spring got earlier, so did the indications of autumn - trees in 2020 went bare on average 4.3 days earlier than the baseline. The report also said that, while substantial snow fell in 2018, 2013, 2010 and 2009, the number and severity of such weather events have declined since the 1960s. Sir James Bevan, the head of the Environment Agency, said there are more than five million homes at risk of flooding in England - and "that risk is rising as the climate changes"."We can't remove the risk but we can reduce it," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

One study warns that seven times as many people will be threatened by flooding in the next 25 years. The wrong strategies have also led to dangerous floods. For years, cities and municipalities relied on ever higher and more stable dams. The consequences were dramatic, as the water would find a way. But now, Europe is rethinking its strategy. "Let the water in" is the new approach, pioneered by engineers in the Netherlands. In Dordrecht, rather than using increasingly massive dams in the event of flooding, the city makes space for water. Playgrounds, sports facilities and whole residential areas are built in a way that absorbs rising water levels, without the houses getting their "feet" wet. "We have a system where nature helps and protects us from the consequences of climate change and rising sea levels," says Marcel Stive, professor of hydraulic engineering. The cathedral city of Cologne has also learned from previous floods. Along the Rhine River, alluvial meadows absorb water, while special pump systems and mobile flood barriers help protect the city. The floodplain valley near Lenzen in Brandenburg is also a success story. The old dike was cut through, restoring 420 hectares of floodplains. Nature is thriving there. "Rare species such as the white-tailed eagle and the whooper swan have found a new home," says floodplain researcher Meike Kleinwächter, "and that attracts tourists." The French town of Nevers realized years ago that a river should not be constricted. Fallow land, floodplain forests and marshlands have been established at the confluence of the Loire and Allier rivers. These measures render the river more predictable and less dangerous during floods. __ DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is preparing the most comprehensive assessment on the state of global heating since 2013. Over the next two weeks, the scientists will go through their findings line by line with representatives of 195 governments. Experts say the report will be a "wake-up call" to governments. It is expected that the short, 40-page Summary for Policymakers will play an important role in guiding global leaders who will come to Glasgow in November to deal with critical climate questions. As the world has warmed over the past 30 years, the IPCC has become the most important platform for summarising the state of scientific understanding of the problem, its impacts and solutions. This year, though, the panel's report takes places as extreme weather events have shaken the US and Canada, Europe and Asia. The question of the role played by human-induced climate change is being asked more loudly than ever. Formed in 1988, the IPCC's role is to provide politicians with assessments every six or seven years on the science, the impacts and the potential options for tackling climate change. Over the years, its reports have become more strongly worded as the evidence has mounted. In 2013, its assessment said that humans were the "dominant cause" of global warming since the 1950s. That document helped set the scene for the Paris climate agreement signed in 2015. As well as its six- or seven-year assessments, the IPCC has also produced special studies looking at specific scientific questions. In 2018, the IPCC released a special report on keeping global temperature rise under 1.5C. This document has had a significant impact on an emerging generation of young people, willing to take to the streets to demand a political response."The 1.5C report was really kind of instrumental for young people to use that science to marshal their efforts towards action," said Ko Barrett, a vice chair of the IPCC and a head of research at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa)."I think maybe the report surprised us all, that the report had such an impact in getting people to think, wow, this is not some big future problem. This is like right now."The IPCC's latest summary of the science, to be published on 9 August, is also likely to have a big impact. In a couple of months, world leaders will come to Glasgow to try to advance the world's efforts against rising temperatures. The IPCC's forthcoming report will be required reading for many attending COP26."I think it's going to be a wake-up call, there's no doubt about that," said Richard Black, an honorary research fellow at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London."But then again, so are some of the real world events that we're seeing around us at the moment.

In Germany dozens of people were unaccounted for, with the Chancellor Angela Merkel describing the floods as a catastrophe. Torrential rain has also devastated parts of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.  Survivors have described the terrifying speed at which water levels rose.   Some politicians in Germany say the extreme weather is the result of global warming and they're calling for more urgent action to counter climate change. Clive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting - from Jenny Hill in Erftstadt, Germany - Anna Holligan in the Dutch town of Valkenberg - and chief environment correspondent Justin Rowlatt on the threat posed by climate change.

It is NOT about individual weather events, although climate change can result in large-scale shifts in weather patterns. Causes of climate change Some gases present in our atmosphere make it work like a greenhouse so we call them greenhouse gases (GHG): The higher their concentration, the more they trap heat. This is great for starting your tomatoes during a chilly spring but this is not good for human beings on this planet. These greenhouse gases include the well known carbon dioxide of course but also methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs, HFCs), etc. Since the industrial revolution, we have been burning a lot of fossil fuels (such as oil, coal and natural gas), therefore our human activities have contributed to a 45% increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, from 280 ppm in 1750 to 415 ppm in 2019. But there is a correlation between CO2 concentration and temperatures (as we found out in my video about ice cores in Antarctica) therefore as CO2 emissions increase so does the global average temperature on Earth. Ok, so greenhouse gases cause climate change but more precisely, which sectors are these emissions coming from? The Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) breaks down our carbon emissions like this. A few things are interesting here. Although GHG emissions and climate change are often pictured as cars and airplanes, you can see that it would be more accurate to draw them as fields, steaks, concrete buildings with heaters and air conditioners and factories building things as these three sectors combined represent about 76% of our global GHG emissions. Although we often talk about emissions, another issue from a climate change perspective is the reduction of carbon sinks, like deforestation which reduces CO2 absorption. A few things make this a little more complicated. Firstly: The rise in temperature has a lot of inertia, meaning it is not going to stop overnight even if we stopped our emissions today. Secondly: Positive feedback loops: smaller white surfaces on the planet reflect less the rays of the sun resulting in more heat absorption. Also, the hotter it gets, the more air conditioning we use. We saw this is already a major challenge but it is also an opportunity as we’ll see in a minute. Thirdly: the permafrost conceals huge amounts of methane which would act like a climate bomb if liberated. The implications for us humans are numerous: more catastrophes such as forest fires, hurricanes, tsunamis, draughts, viruses like Covid-19 and sea level rise resulting in refugee crisis, conflicts, loss of crops and biodiversity, diseases and economic downfall. In a 2016 report, the IPCC strongly suggested keeping the global warming under 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels to avoid dramatic outcomes. Even it it does not look like much, 1.5° makes a big difference on planet Earth!	climate change,climate change causes,climate change definition,climate change solutions,causes,definition,solutions,project drawdown,2021,drawing of climate change,sustainability,environment,whiteboard animation,sustainability illustrated,education,Climate change 2021: definition causes & top 10 solutions,what is climate change? start here,Is It Too Late To Stop Climate Change?,Causes and Effects of Climate Change,climate change 101,climate,global warming	27	Education	PT8M34S	514	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z5OYFCDOw7A/maxresdefault.jpg	1	4940	259	4	0	47

Eerie flood in Edinburgh, Scotland	Natural disaster 5 July 2021. Europe is experiencing abnormal climate changes! Eerie flood in Edinburgh, Scotland #Edinburgh #Scotland #hurricane #wind #wave #hail #storm #flood #rain #weather #Naturaldisasters #news A natural disaster is a major adverse event resulting from natural processes of the Earth; examples include floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, rain, hail, wildfire, waves, wind, snow, weather and other geologic processes. Edinburgh was hit with nearly half of its average July rainfall in under an hour on Sunday, as storms caused flooding across the city. Trains were stopped and homes and businesses fought to keep the water out. The newly-opened St James Quarter shopping centre was also affected. Council flood prevention teams are working with Scottish Water to find blockages and clear surface water. A yellow warning of rain and a Sepa flood alert remain in place on Monday. Edinburgh council said up to 37mm of rain had fallen - beyond the capacity of the city's drains and sewerage system. Councillor Lesley Macinnes, transport and environment convener, said: "Our roads and flood prevention teams have worked extremely hard, throughout Sunday and overnight, to minimise the impact of this intense, sudden downpour. "No city's drainage systems are designed to cope with the sort of short, sharp volume of water. Daily monitoring of earthquakes around the planet.

The fact that this comes as a big surprise is because Canada is one of the coldest countries on planet. Experts blame a heat dome as the reason behind this but the real cause is climate change.

But much of the Northern Hemisphere is also in the midst of an exceptionally early, hot summer. From North Africa, to the Arabian Peninsula, to Eastern Europe, maximum daily temperatures have exceeded 45 C in several places, and are even reaching the 50s in the Sahara. Global National's Dawna Friesen speaks with Katharine Hayhoe, a world-renowned Canadian climate scientist, about the importance of talking about solutions when discussing the climate crisis.

As a record-breaking heat wave afflicts western North America, scientists are expecting more extreme weather events like it in Canada's future, as climate change grips the planet. Eric Sorensen looks at the dramatic changes to come as global warming intensifies. Meanwhile, a timely federal report has found that whether it's individuals, private business or the government itself - much of Canada is still not prepared to handle the major consequences that will be brought on by climate change. As David Akin explains, the warming planet will affect everything from the food we eat, to tourism and infrastructure.

Heather Yourex-West reports on the deadly toll the extreme weather is taking and how first responders are being flooded with emergency calls. As that happens throughout western North America, scientists are expecting more similar, extreme weather events in Canada's future, as climate change grips the planet. Eric Sorensen explains what's being forecasted. Meanwhile, a new report from Natural Resources Canada finds much of the country, including people, companies and governments, is not equipped to handle extreme weather,. As David Akin explains, federal scientists warn action needs to be taken now. In Florida, the Miami Herald has published photos taken just two days before Champlain Tower collapsed, showing how badly repairs were needed at the Surfside complex. As Jackson Proskow reports, attention is turning to other aging apartment buildings in the Miami area. Plus, Canada's actual COVID-19 death toll could be much higher than what's been recorded, according to a new study by the Royal Society of Canada. Abigail Bimman explains how thousands more fatalities may have gone unreported. And Wilson 5, the foundation from the family of billionaire and Lululemon founder Chip Wilson, has donated $4 million to the B.C. Parks Foundation, to help preserve and protect the province's rare forests on three different islands. Robin Gill reports.

And so do American universities. Why, you ask? Because China is pumping billions of dollars into America’s elite academic institutions. A sizable portion of that cash goes to “research” into the “climate crisis” narrative. China gets stronger as the presumed climate crisis encourages western nations to voluntarily make their energy infrastructure weaker. Along the way, universities are sent loads of cash tied to the Communist Chinese government. Aren’t you a little suspicious of CCP motives? Are universities? FOLLOW us! Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ClearEnergyAlliance Twitter: https://twitter.com/clearenergy Parler: https://parler.com/profile/ClearEnergy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/clearenergyalliance For list of sources and downloadable transcript: https://clearenergyalliance.com/project/china-universities-climate-change/ Script: Is China undermining America’s economic and national security by funneling billions of dollars into elite Universities such as Harvard, Yale, and Cornell? The U.S. Department of Education has discovered disturbing evidence that it’s almost certainly happening. And what about all the hysteria concerning catastrophic man-caused climate change? Is China using its money to encourage universities to stoke climate fears? I know, I know…You can’t say these things without some people getting so mad their hair catches fire. But how about we examine this possibility with less emotion and more logic. Don’t people, companies, and nations take advantage of every opportunity they can to advance their own interests? And hasn’t China proven itself to be extremely aggressive in this regard? Let’s look at the money. The Department of Education recently began enforcing a law that had been ignored for decades. The law requires universities to disclose foreign contributions that exceed $250,000 dollars. Investigators discovered that ten universities including Harvard, Yale, and Georgetown, have accepted loads of cash without disclosing the funding to the feds. And when the Education Department told universities they had better come clean, disclosures of a whopping $6.5 billion came flooding in. This comes on the heels of the chairman of Harvard’s Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department being indicted for lying to the Defense Department about his involvement with the Chinese government. A lot of the $6.5 billion in undeclared university funding came from China, but also from Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other nations that the Department says are… “seeking to project ‘soft power,’ steal sensitive and proprietary research and development data and other intellectual property, and spread propaganda benefitting foreign governments.” So now let’s apply a little logic to what’s happening with climate change. Most of the research which suggests the bulk of climate change is man-caused and that the consequences will be catastrophic is coming out of universities. The more dire the threat, the more attention and funding researchers receive. China, and other non-free nations love the hype. Western nations are spending hundreds of billions of dollars to lower their CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, China slyly nods in agreement but keeps building cheap coal-fired power plants that dramatically increase emissions. Here’s just one example of how China uses universities to promote climate alarmism. In 2018, academic researchers claimed climate change was going to increase the cost of beer. Higher priced beer is something people would definitely be concerned about. Turns out, the study was funded largely by eight Chinese organizations and was conducted mostly by Chinese researchers. If you consider climate change in this harsh light, it makes perfect sense that China is manipulating fears of a climate catastrophe to its advantage. The Chinese want the U.S. and other nations to pass laws making energy and manufacturing more expensive while they expand their economy, take our jobs and do so with little regard for the environment. No one should be surprised by this. Regardless of what you think about the issue of climate change, you would be naïve to believe it’s not being used as a strategic geo-political tool by China and other nations that want to weaken America, and the freedoms we enjoy. For the Clear Energy Alliance, I’m Mark Mathis. Power On.		28	Science & Technology	PT4M9S	249	2d	hd	true		1	98886	143	9	0	30

This according to a UN report that says that human life will be reshaped in the next decades,...even with further a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Choi Min-jung reports. Pointing out the "worst is yet to come",… climate experts are warning that people should expect to witness the dire consequences of drastic climate change within 30 years. This is according to a draft report from the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,… accessed exclusively by AFP. The draft warns of the severe impacts climate change will have on the planet,... including weather, food production, and eco-systems. The report also draws attention to the effect of global warming on humanity,… warning that "life on Earth can recover from a drastic climate shift by evolving into new species and creating new ecosystems",…. however humans cannot. The draft reports went on to say that a rise in global temperatures by more than 1-point-5 degrees Celsius will bring irreversible consequences. However, the earth's temperature has already risen by 1-point-1 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels,… and looking at the current trend, experts say it may even reach 3 degrees. This is well above the goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius. Even with 2-hundred nations abiding by the agreement, 14-percent of the global population will be exposed to severe heatwaves at least once in 5 years. The IPCC stresses that it is crucial for all levels of society,... from individuals, businesses, to governments,... to do their parts to avoid the worst-case scenario.

You can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8JZo6PzpCU Now Facebook won't show it to many people — not even to my subscribers. Facebook's also punishing Stossel TV by showing our other videos less. All because Facebook foolishly gave Emmanuel Vincent, a recent PhD graduate from France, the power to censor. Vincent assembled a group of like-minded scientists into a group called Climate Feedback climatefeedback.org that declared parts of my video “misleading," or "partially false." What facts did the “fact-checkers” correct? NONE! There was not a single hard fact that in the video that was wrong. We address the censor’s claims here, listing our sources: https://www.johnstossel.com/climate-feedback-response/ I asked one Vincent “reviewer,” the only one willing to be interviewed, why I deserve censorship even though our facts were correct. “The problem is the omission of contextual information rather than specific "facts" being "wrong,”" says Patrick Brown, Assistant Professor at San Jose State University. Some “fact-check." “What kills me,” I complain to Brown, “is that when Climate Feedback rates me partly false, that significantly reduces the number of people who see it -- and see my other videos. So this is really important to me that it be done fairly.” “I am sympathetic with what you're saying,” he responds. “At the same time as a consumer of information, I like the idea of having some type of system where content can be compared to what experts think.” But Facebook’s choice of "experts" is absurd. Emmanuel Vincent proudly says “all the climate scientists that I know personally agree that climate change is real, that it’s serious, and we can do something about it.” Well, of course climate change is real! But how serious a threat it is, and whether we can do much about it with today’s technology deserves debate. Victor’s little group STOPS debate. Remarkably, Facebook lets them. Watch the video above and decide for yourself.

Yet, with existing technologies, that transition would only tackle 55% of the emissions that cause the climate to change. It would tackle the emissions that come from the electricity and heat we use in buildings, from our energy system more broadly, and from transport. To tackle the remaining 45% of emissions, which come from industry, agriculture, and land use, we need to transition to a circular economy.

As humans across the world are experiencing the impact of climate change, they are taking precautious steps to reduce their carbon footprint. From using renewable energy to investing in energy-efficient buildings, everyone has a part to play. But are these steps a little too late to fight climate change? The jury is still out there.

EU Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans said "I support taxing kerosene like other fuels" and "nobody has to fly ten or twelve times a year". He did not however back German Green Party leader Annalena Baerbock's call for a ban on short-haul flights. The Greens' popularity has soared ahead of a September general election. In Germany, as in many other countries, jet fuel based on kerosene is exempt from energy taxes. Ms Baerbock is the Greens' candidate to replace Angela Merkel of the Christian Democrats (CDU) as chancellor. Mrs Merkel, now in her fourth term, became Germany's first woman chancellor in 2005, and is not running again. Opinion polls suggest the Greens have drawn level with the CDU, on just under 25%. If they keep up that momentum the Greens could lead the next German coalition, with Ms Baerbock becoming chancellor. The CDU's junior partner in government, the Social Democrat Party (SPD), is on about 15%."A family travelling by train should pay less for a train ticket than for short-haul flights. Short-haul flights should no longer exist in the longer run," Ms Baerbock told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. She said that a Greens-led government would make budget flights - such as those to Majorca costing just €29 (£25; $35) - a thing of the past. "Climate-friendly taxation of flights would stop such dumping prices," she said. She also said the Greens' emergency climate programme would include making solar panels compulsory for new buildings. Speaking to Germany's Funke Media group, Mr Timmermans said that if EU citizens could be persuaded to limit themselves to one flight a year "then there would be no problem - neither for the climate, nor for their wallets". Last month French National Assembly deputies voted in favour of a bill to end short-haul flights where the same journey could be made by train in under two-and-a-half hours. The French upper house - the Senate - has not yet voted on the bill to make it law. About 2.4% of global CO2 emissions come from aviation. Together with other gases and the water vapour trails produced by aircraft, the industry is responsible for around 5% of global warming. But aviation emissions are growing fast - outpacing improvements in fuel efficiency. In Germany, there was criticism of the Greens' stance from Mrs Merkel's centre-right group and from the opposition liberal Free Democrats (FDP). Ulrich Lange of the CDU's Bavarian allies, the CSU, said "it's clear that aviation must make its contribution to protecting the climate. But banning short-haul flights and massive price hikes for flights are the wrong way to go".

Support this channel directly by becoming a Patreon backer: https://www.patreon.com/OurChangingClimate In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why capitalism is killing us (and the planet) by causing climate change. Specifically, I look at how capitalism's multinationals like ExxonMobil and BP are responsible for increased emissions and ultimately the climate crisis we are living through today. Capitalism's growth-at-all-costs paradigm runs counter to the material realities of the Earth we live on. In addition to causing climate change, capitalists have found insidious ways to profit off of and engrain free market, neoliberal ideas into the global economy in the wake of climate change-fueled disasters. This is called disaster capitalism and will only get worse as the climate crisis causes more and more chaos. Flying in the face of this capitalist destruction are countless revolutionary movements and ideas that are working to dismantle the profit and growth economy and lift up the people instead. Eco-socialism moving into communism, degrowth, buen vivir, and food sovereignty are just a few philosophical tactics that are being championed by the masses as a means of countering the destructive tendencies of capitalism.

Crash Course Geography #14	Today we’re going to talk about climate change which is when there is a change in the average weather patterns in a region over a long period of time - these changes can be natural or human-caused. We’ll discuss the main driving forces of climate change in the past and show you how what’s happening now is unlike anything in the past. Global warming, or when there is an increase in the average surface temperature of the planet, has been well-documented since the Industrial Revolution, and scientists have concluded that there is a 95% probability that human activities like burning fossil fuels, industrialization, modern agriculture, and deforestation have caused most of this most recent warming. And while individual actions do matter in helping to curb the disastrous implications of a warming planet, it’s also up to us to hold corporations and governments responsible for the policies and the large-scale emissions that play a disproportionate role in impacting our atmosphere and climate.

But as that viewpoint has become untenable in the face of overwhelming evidence, this talk explores the more subtle, passive forms of climate change denial that are still pervasive in the 2020s. By recognizing these passive forms of denial in our everyday lives, we enable ourselves to move past them, and begin working towards climate solutions every day. Patrick Belmont is a dad and river scientist with a rapidly shrinking carbon footprint. He thoroughly enjoys studying some things that almost nobody cares about, like how and why rivers meander, but he spends most of his time trying to solve society’s most pressing problems, like figuring out where all that mud in the Mississippi River comes from and how to reduce impacts of wildfire in the western US. And of course, he is dead serious about stopping climate change. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Why have policymakers lagged behind the science and technology? How much do individuals make a difference or has it needed people to work out how to make money out of climate change for politicians to take action? Is there a human tipping point - allied to the scientific tipping point - where more radical action becomes inevitable? And how can we reimagine a more positive future?

Everyone’s talking about climate change but what is our climate? And why is it changing? Our climate has been changing much faster and there are many ways you and I can make a difference. Learn more about climate change and what you can do: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange.html https://www.climatekids.ca * * * * * Transcript * * * * * Everyone’s talking about climate change. But what is our climate? And why is it changing? Our climate is the earth’s normal weather, over a very long time. It usually takes hundreds, or thousands of years for the climate to change. But recently, our climate has been changing much faster. All these changes make life harder for our plants, animals, and for people around the world. And the biggest cause of climate change, is humans. Including you and me. When we use fuel, like oil and gasoline, or remove forests to make room for cities or farms, we release greenhouse gases into our atmosphere. These greenhouse gasses cause our climate to get warmer. Normally, when the heat from the sun warms our planet, some of the heat reflects back into space. But greenhouse gases act like a big blanket, holding some of it in. This extra heat can cause all sorts of problems for our planet; and the plants, animals and people who live here. Our ice and snow is melting faster. Our oceans are getting warmer, and higher. And our weather is becoming more extreme; with more heat waves, heavy rainfalls and powerful hurricanes. Luckily, many countries around the world are working together to fight climate change. And there are lots easy ways you and I can help too. Like reusing things, instead of throwing them out; instead of driving, ride your bike or take the bus; use less electricity; and eat food grown closer to home. You and I - we can make a difference. We can fight climate change.	climate change,climate,environment,environment canada,what is climate change,how climate change works	28	Science & Technology	PT1M53S	113	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QlQ-MEZgRGY/maxresdefault.jpg		7576	126	7	0

The College also considers itself a trustee of our Western philosophical and theological inheritance tracing to Athens and Jerusalem, a heritage finding its clearest expression in the American experiment of self-government under law. By training the young in the liberal arts, Hillsdale College prepares students to become leaders worthy of that legacy. By encouraging the scholarship of its faculty, it contributes to the preservation of that legacy for future generations. By publicly defending that legacy, it enlists the aid of other friends of free civilization and thus secures the conditions of its own survival and independence.	hillsdale,politics,constitution,equality,liberty,freedom,free speech,lecture,learn,america	27	Education	PT55M52S	3352	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CA1zUW4uOSw/maxresdefault.jpg		326214	11845	515	0	4059

It’s getting hotter and drier, with sandstorms now reaching all the way to Bucharest. As they try to prevent the worst, environmentalists are turning to reforestation. The effects of climate change can be clearly seen and felt in the Romanian region of Oltenia. Where once green meadows and forests lined the banks of the River Danube, swathes of sand are now expanding. The area in question now covers more than 800 square kilometers along the Danube. Wind blows sand into villages, and even as far as the capital, Bucharest, more than 200 kilometers away. It’s the result of a combination of global warming and reckless agricultural policies. In the 1970s and 1980s, dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu had forests cut down and lakes drained as he sought to promote large-scale agricultural production. Environmentalists, entrepreneurs and local politicians are now trying to stop the ongoing devastation in the south of their country. Bucharest lawmaker and environmental activist Octavian Berceanu travels regularly to the region, in order to discover the main causes of the desertification. Together with forestry engineer Dan Popescu, he wants to convince locals and officials to plant new trees in fields that have become unusable. Farmers can hardly grow any crops in the sandy soil. Even undemanding cereals like corn no longer find sufficient nutrients there. Desperate farmers are now mainly growing even less demanding melon crops. What’s already happening in Oltenia is also threatening other parts of Europe, as the continent feels the effects of climate change: one summer of drought after another, with serious consequences for both environment and agriculture. ------------------------------------------------------------------ DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The actions will take now will determine the future for generations to come. Now is not a time for half measures nor is it a time where we can we afford to continue our prioritization of profit over people. Climate change is greater than any one of us, but it requires every single one of us to come together to ensure there can and will be a future for the next to come. This isn't a problem half measures can solve. It goes beyond energy efficiency and zero net emissions. We need to actively remove carbon from the atmosphere -- and do so within the next ten years or else we face irreparable damage to our atmosphere. The implications are huge-- mass disease caused by carbon pollution, rising sea levels, extinction, shortages of every major resource, migration inland. The cost of waiting far exceeds the price to act now. We need bold policies that put the life and continuity of humankind above profit. Make sure to like and share with everyone you know! We need to spread these information, we need our society to wake up! #climatechange #shortfilm	climate,climate change,climate change film,climate change short film,short film,short movie,climate short film,climate change movie,Fridays for future,fff,climate crisis,climate catastrophy,climate crisis short film,existential crisis	1	Film & Animation	PT3M38S	218	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jAa58N4Jlos/maxresdefault.jpg		54824	1058	20	0	69

But was it a turning point in climate change history? Emissions dropped and the streets were empty, yet CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere rose to new highs. We review the Copernicus Climate Change Service data from 2020, highlighting the rapidly warming Arctic with its 38°C record in Siberia, severe hurricane season in the Atlantic, and the many droughts, floods and wildfires across the world. We heard a lot about the 'new normal' imposed by coronavirus restrictions, but are these changes the beginning of a shift towards a lower-emissions society? Are we ready to 'flatten the curve' on climate change? Or is 2020 just a chink in the upwards trend of global warming? Our guests are: Carlo Buontempo, Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service Nathan Méténier, Climate and Environment Activist, Student, and Member of the UN Secretary General Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change General António Guterres Dr Jane Goodall, Environmental Activist and Conservationist Oksana Tarasova, Oksana Tarasova, Head Of Atmospheric Environment Research Division, World Meteorological Organisation Join us for a live discussion with our guests.

Subscribe to the podcast here: mind-over-chatter.captivate.fm/listen We cover a lot of ground: from hippos and polar bears to how many times ‘sex’ and ‘tea’ were mentioned on TV between 2017 and 2018… so what’s all of this got to do with sustainability and climate change? Join us to find out! Our storytelling experts this time are Richard Staley (lecturer in the history and philosophy of science, Sarah Dillon (author, researcher and broadcaster) and Martin Rees (cosmologist, astrophysicist, and Astronomer Royal).

Guest Bios: Martin Rees (@LordMartinRees) Martin Rees (Lord Rees of Ludlow, OM FRS) is an astrophysicist and cosmologist, and the UK's Astronomer Royal. He has been increasingly concerned in recent years about long-term global issues – the pressures that a growing and more demanding population are placing on the environment, sustainability and biodiversity; and the impact of powerful new technologies. He is co-founder of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER) at the University of Cambridge with a focus on these issues. In addition to his research publications, which total over 500, he has written extensively for a general readership. His ten books include 'Just Six Numbers', 'Our Cosmic Habitat', ‘Gravity’s Fatal Attraction’, and the recently-published, 'On the Future: Prospects for Humanity'. https://www.martinrees.uk/ Dr Sarah Dillon (@drsarahdillon) Sarah Dillon is a Reader in Literature and Film in the Faculty of English at the University of Cambridge. Her forthcoming book (Storylistening: Narrative Evidence and Public Reasoning, co-authored with Claire Craig) makes a case for the value of attention to stories, and the importance of understanding their functions and effects, in the context of high-level decision-making and policy-making. http://drsarahdillon.com/ https://www.english.cam.ac.uk/people/Sarah.Dillon/ Dr Richard Staley Hans Rausing Lecturer and Reader in History and Philosophy of Science. Currently leading the Making Climate History project. The project develops a fundamental new perspective on the histories and geographies of climate change by linking making and knowing in the emergence of the climate sciences over the past two centuries. We examine the entwined social, physical, and economic timescales of climate change over the entire period it took to remake the climate, and to recognise that we are changing it. https://www.people.hps.cam.ac.uk/index/teaching-officers/staley	Cambridge,Cambridge University	27	Education	PT1H6M43S	403	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G9AxUZwENfc/maxresdefault.jpg		3349	86	2	0	11

Help NCSE build their climate change in scripted media database: https://ncse.ngo/understanding-climate-change-scripted-media-project In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, we look at how and why TV comedies get climate change so wrong. We look at the last 30 years of television comedies that address climate change from The Simpsons to South Park to The Good Place to Modern Family to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia in order to understand why TV comedies get climate change so wrong. TV comedies use a number of character archetypes that turn environmentalists into obnoxious pariahs, directly deny the existence of climate change in the case of South Park, or build jokes and comedic elements on how hopeless climate action can be. TV comedies ultimately have undermined needed progress on climate change and climate action by approaching the issue of climate change in an unproductive way. To conclude we offer a number of avenues through which TV comedies like The Simpsons, The Politician, and The Good Place might be able to actually spur climate action through jokes and comedy.

The Climate Action Alliance is leading the race to zero. The 2015 Paris Agreement committed the international community to restrict global warming to “well below 2 degrees Celsius” and aim, if possible, for 1.5C. Signatories to the landmark Agreement are due to meet online for a Climate Ambition Summit on 12 December, the fifth anniversary of the pact, and to set out new and ambitious commitments for the next five years, which could provide a major boost for the next landmark meeting, COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, next November.	daily news story,news & features	25	News & Politics	PT2M1S	121	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hcsy_gSWV0A/maxresdefault.jpg		7515	106	21	0	13

The Climate Action Tracker group looked at new climate promises from China and other nations, along with the carbon plans of US President-elect Joe Biden. These commitments would mean the rise in world temperatures could be held to 2.1C by the end of this century. Previous estimates indicated up to 3C of heating, with disastrous impacts. But the experts are worried the long-term optimism is not matched by short-term plans to cut CO2.

And while there’s little doubt that climate change is to blame, proving that fault for specific weather events hasn’t really been possible… until now. » Subscribe to Seeker! http://bit.ly/subscribeseeker » Watch more Elements! http://bit.ly/ElementsPlaylist » Visit our shop at http://shop.seeker.com An emerging field called extreme-event attribution is helping us measure and verify the relationship between the climate crisis and extreme weather. Not only does this have huge implications for predicting and modeling our planet’s future, but it could also help us better prepare for living in an increasingly extreme world. When we talk about the impacts of the climate crisis, we’re really talking about distinguishing the influence of natural factors from anthropogenic factors on Earth’s climate cycle. Basically, this means teasing apart Earth’s natural climate cycles from human-caused climate change. A way to begin doing this is to examine the “fingerprints” we humans have left behind on Earth’s climate. By matching both the observed and modeled patterns of Earth’s climate, scientists can positively identify the “fingerprints'' associated with these changes. Following the tracks of these fingerprints has helped scientists link climate change with more general trends, like rising sea levels and global temperatures. #climatechange #environment #naturaldisasters #weather #science #seeker #elements Read More: The Decade of Attribution Science https://slate.com/technology/2019/12/attribution-science-field-explosion-2010s-climate-change.html "Just as medical researchers can study how smoking cigarettes changes people’s risk of lung cancer by comparing data from smokers and nonsmokers, attribution scientists compare events on our planet with those on a hypothetical “Planet B,” one that is untouched by greenhouse gas emissions."

The country is now the world’s largest manufacturer of solar panels, lithium ion batteries, and electric vehicles. But while China has stepped up in these regards, it is still the global leader in carbon emissions, and burns more coal than the rest of the world combined. As President-elect Joe Biden looks to reassert American leadership in green energy and climate initiatives, it remains to be seen whether the U.S. and China can work collaboratively to address the climate crisis.

Research commissioned by the Ministry of Defence published in June this year points to a “growing recognition that climate change may aggravate existing threats to international peace and security.” The report, which is titled ‘A changing climate: Exploring the implications of climate change for UK defence and security’, advises the Ministry of Defence on how to prepare the British Armed Forces for the effects of escalating climate change, including increased unrest and conflict resulting from shrinking food and water resources and the displacement of peoples. The report recommends that the Ministry of Defence alter the design of war games and strategic training exercises to account for “multiple simultaneous large-scale disasters” resulting from climate change, and to “support interoperability across the Armed Forces, emergency services, police, fire services and coastguard.” The action called on the government to act to avert the increase in unrest, conflict and war anticipated by the Ministry of Defence report. The Committee on Climate Change – which advises the government on emissions reduction and reports on their progress – revealed in June this year that the government had reached only two of it’s 31 milestones and was on track with only four of the 21 indicators identified on the path to zero emissions. [2] The action made the point that, in this context, speaking up about consequences of unchecked warning is an act of remembrance. #RemembranceDay #ClimateConflict A changing climate: Exploring the implications of climate change for UK defence and security: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/930787/dcdc_report_changing_climate_gsp_RR-A487.pdf Reducing UK emissions: 2020 Progress Report to Parliament: https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/reducing-uk-emissions-2020-progress-report-to-parliament/ Help XR mobilise and donate: https://rebellion.earth/donate/ Extinction Rebellion UK: https://extinctionrebellion.uk/ International: https://rebellion.global/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/ExtinctionR Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/XRebellionUK/ World Map of Extinction Rebellion Groups: https://rebellion.global/branches/ [NW] ‎‎ #extinctionrebellion #climatechange #globalwarming	extinction rebellion,climate change,xr,sixth extinction,global warming,air pollution,activism,Ecological crisis,act now,tell the truth,join xr,protest,carbon emissions,fossil fuels,biodiversity loss,citizens assembly,donald bell,cenotaph,armistice,British Army,veteran,wreath	29	Nonprofits & Activism	PT4M12S	252	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jj8kFAPuHHk/maxresdefault.jpg		5343	422	152	0	442

With the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, 197 countries agreed to set emission targets that would limit global temperature rise 1.5 degrees Celsius by capping greenhouse emissions at "net-zero" -- or absorbing as much carbon as they emit -- by 2050. So far, only two countries (Gambia and Morocco) are hitting their targets, while the biggest emitters are falling flat, or ignoring their goals entirely. How can we hold these countries accountable? Enter the Climate Action Tracker. This video was part of the Countdown Global Launch on 10.10.2020. (Watch the full event here: https://youtu.be/5dVcn8NjbwY.)

Sources & further reading: https://sites.google.com/view/sourcesgeoengineering By the end of the 21st century, humanity is becoming desperate. Decades of heatwaves and droughts have led to unusually poor harvests, while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year. In the tropical zones, millions suffer from famine and resource wars have made millions more flee to the north. As things quickly get worse, in an act of desperation, the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan... It is far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out. But the failure of world leaders to effectively address climate change, makes it far from impossible. So in the near future it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change: Geoengineering. Interventions so massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior. Or make everything much worse. What is geoengineering, is it really an option and what if it goes wrong?

Because it appears efforts to cut CO2 won’t suffice to avoid irreversible climate change. But does geoengineering offer a real solution? Or is it just human hubris? Some scientists believe that we need to explore radical, and perhaps dangerous, technologies in order to be able to lower the earth’s temperature through geoengineering in the near future. Science journalist Ingolf Baur explores the feasibility and risks of leading geoengineering projects. His journey takes him to meet scientists in Switzerland, Iceland, the US and Peru. Along the way, he encounters two very different strategies: One is to fish climate-damaging CO2 from the atmosphere and sink it underground or in the deep sea. The other, and this is the far more controversial strategy, seeks to develop techniques that dim sunlight. Global warming is causing entire mountain ridges like the Moosfluh above Switzerland’s Aletsch Glacier to break off. Such dramatic changes could increase the pressure to try geoengineering. Its most prominent proponent is David Keith from Harvard University in the US. He’s devised experiments to to sound out the possibilities of "solar geoengineering." His idea is for fleets of aircraft to dump millions of tons of sulfur into the stratosphere every year, where it should reflect part of the incoming sunlight back into space. As audacious as this method seems, it’s actually no different to what happens during volcanic eruptions. Or could we still manage to get greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere again? In Iceland, a group of researchers is using a special process to filter carbon dioxide from the air and pump it 2,000 meters deep into basalt rock. The surprise: after a few months, the CO2 is already reacting chemically and turning to stone, which renders it harmless - permanently. The quantities are still far too small, but it shows that as controversial and risky as some geoengineering methods may be, in the end we may need technology to avert or at least mitigate the effects of climate collapse. ---------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

There is never any good news. Only graphs that get more and more red and angry. Almost every year breaks some horrible record, from the harshest heat waves to the most rapid Glacier melt. It’s endless and relentless. We have known for decades that rapid Climate Change is being caused by the release of Greenhouse Gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO2 than in the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it so hard to just stop emitting these gases?

By the end of the century, 75% of the world's population will experience extreme heat and if current trends continue, whole regions of Asia will be rendered uninhabitable by direct heat. But for many, deadly heat is already part of their daily lives. In this episode, we meet those who are most vulnerable to heat - schoolchildren in Sumba, the elderly in Singapore and slum-dwellers in Delhi - and learn how heat is a silent killer.

That is to say, if you measure the temperature everywhere in the world all at once, and then average those results together, you will get a number that is always the same. Of course, in any given moment some places on earth are very hot and others are very cold, and individual temperatures will vary with day and night as the earth rotates on its axis, and with the seasons of the year as the earth revolves around the sun, but they all average out to be the same number every day, every month, every year. That number might change less than one degree in ten thousand years. In fact, the average temperature of the earth is one of the most stable numbers in nature at just a tad below 59 degrees Fahrenheit, all the time. Like the rising of the sun and the passing of the seasons, this is a fact you can really depend upon. And for good reason. All the plants and animals on earth have adapted to the temperature of their local environment, as well as its fluctuations through the seasons. From blossoming of flowers in the spring to shedding of leaves in the fall, from gathering of food in the summer to hibernating underground in the winter, plants and animals are exquisitely well adapted to the baseline temperature and its seasonal fluctuations. A good analogy for the earth comes from my world of medicine. The human body also seeks a stable temperature– of 98.6 degrees – and vigorously defends it. A two-degree rise in our body temperature is defined as a fever, a diseased state that prompts an investigation to determine the cause. A five degree increase severely impairs us. An eight degree increase can be fatal. Why? Because our cells, organs, and tissues have evolved to work best at our baseline temperature, just like living organisms in the environment. Biology and climate. A stable marriage for the ages. Until it isn’t. Let’s take a closer look. Most people know the carbon cycle by heart: plants breathe in carbon dioxide, or CO2, and breathe out oxygen. Using energy from the sun through photosynthesis, plants incorporate those carbon atoms into their structures - their roots, trunks, and branches – and then discard the oxygen. Thus, over large spans of time, plants have depleted the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and enriched it with pure oxygen. As the trees died and were covered by the earth, their carbon atoms become trapped underground as organic material, buried forever… or so it seemed. Over millions of years, as the atmosphere became more suitable for human life and temperatures moderated at a stable level, the weight of the earth compressed all that organic material into fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. When we humans came along, we realized that there was a lot of energy bound up in those deposits, if we could just drill for them… or dig them up, which we did, of course. Unfortunately, the combustion of those fuels has reversed the process of photosynthesis, returning carbon dioxide to the atmosphere in huge quantities, while releasing massive amounts of energy to produce the electricity for our power grid. The best evidence for the warming of the earth comes from global land and sea temperature measurements that are regularly reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a U.S. government agency that produces gold standard evidence about climate change. Based on these measurements, here is the rise in the average global temperature over the past century presented in five year intervals to dampen annual fluctuations. We humans are used to dealing with existential threats. We are incredibly resourceful and have a strong track record of working together to solve our serious problems. Yet by ignoring the peril of climate change, we face global disruption that could lead to international conflict …, disease…, and, famine all over again. Why would we choose to revisit problems we have already solved? What’s so special about this threat? The root cause of our failure to confront climate change is a system defect in our political process. That defect, that glitch, private campaign financing, which gives rich and powerful interests unnatural control over our democratically elected leaders so that they no longer bend to the will of the people, or do what is right for our world.

In this episode, Rainn Wilson and scientist Gail Whiteman take a helicopter ride to a glacier to learn more about the melting glaciers and climate change. Then they take a drive to a melting ice cap to talk about the economic impact of climate change. Gail Whiteman says the data points to climate change being a BIGGER economic impact on us than if we do nothing. *This show was filmed before Covid-19 became a pandemic and stay at home orders were in place.

The arctic has been warming up for years - and now, the warnings of experts and scientists are clear for everyone to see - the poles are melting. As the differences in temperature between the poles and the equatore reduce, the jetstream winds, which move weather around the globe - are slowing down. The result - extreme weather. High- and low pressure systems remain at the same spot for longer, creating floods and droughts.

His new book, False Alarm: How Climate Change Panic Costs Us Trillions, Hurts the Poor, and Fails to Fix the Planet, is an argument for treating climate as a serious problem but not an extinction-level event requiring such severe and drastic steps as rewiring a large part of the culture and the economy. Bjorn responds directly to some of the most vociferous climate policy critics, including Greta Thunberg, author David Wallace-Wells (The Uninhabitable Earth: Life after Warming), and proponents of the Green New Deal. We also discuss some promising emerging technologies and why worst-case scenarios are often just that—scenarios that are used to motivate the public into action but are not in fact likely to occur. It’s a sobering and even-handed discussion on climate that does not include apocalyptic endings for the planet.

In reality, 97 percent of scientists agree that it is real and only 3 percent are skeptical. A sticking point for some is the estimated timeline, but as Columbia University professor Philip Kitcher points out, a 4-5 Celsius temperature increase that makes the planet uninhabitable is a disaster no matter when it happens. In this video, 9 experts (including professors, astronomers, authors, and historians) explain what climate change looks like, how humans have already and are continuing to contribute to it, how and why it has become politicized, and what needs to happen moving forward for real progress to be made. David Wallace-Wells, journalist and New America Foundation National Fellow, says that the main goal of climate action is not to win over the skeptical minority, but to "make those people who are concerned but still fundamentally complacent about the issue to be really engaged in a way that they prioritize climate change in their politics and their voting and make sure that our leaders think of climate change as a first-order political priority." Read David Wallace-Wells' latest book The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming at https://amzn.to/2CMDSGI ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TRANSCRIPT: GINA MCCARTHY: Climate is always portrayed on newscasts as being some kind of big debate. You know, the big debate among the scientists is that 97 percent of them know it's happening and are really worried about it. Three percent are skeptical. That's not a balance. That's an overwhelming majority and that needs to drive the decision, especially in a democracy. BILL NYE: The more you think about it everybody, 97 percent of the world's scientists – not 97 percent of some institute that somebody started in a remote part of the world and is releasing press releases. Ninety-seven percent of the scientists in the world are very concerned about climate change. PHILIP KITCHER: Climate science is built on views about the atmosphere that have been developed very successfully and in a very rigorous way from the nineteenth century to the present. There isn't any doubt about the mechanisms of the greenhouse effect. There isn't really any doubt about the evidence behind the consensus that says we have contributed enormously to the warming effects that are now becoming apparent not only in the present but also from the record of the earth's average temperature. NYE: You can look at the graphs. You can study the stuff for yourself. If nothing else do this. Wherever you live, get access to the coldest temperature of each year for the last century. And unless you live in just very few places you will see the coldest temperature where you live has steadily increased. They'll be some dips. There'll be some ups, but overall you'll find it – and that's just one that almost everybody who has internet access can get those data, they're available. And just look at that one thing and you'll see the world's getting warmer everybody. MICHELLE THALLER: Now the reason our atmosphere is getting warmer and warmer and warmer is because we humans are putting lots of carbon dioxide up into the atmosphere. And this acts as what we call a greenhouse gas. Sunlight can get through the atmosphere, but the carbon dioxide traps it and it can't release itself back into space so it gets warmer and warmer over time. Carbon dioxide doesn't just warm the atmosphere. It also affects our oceans. When ocean water combines with carbon dioxide to create something called carbonic acid and it makes the oceans more and more acidic over time. And this is a really big problem for marine life. There are things like algae. The algae in the oceans are responsible for most of the oxygen that we breathe. And the algae are having trouble forming because of the higher acid levels in the ocean. So even if the one thing you solved was cooling the earth down, if we continue to put more and more carbon dioxide into our atmosphere there will be other serious repercussions. We could end up killing the ocean life system, for example. NYE: The earth is getting warmer faster than it has ever gotten before and that's the problem. It's not that the world hasn't had more carbon dioxide. It's not that the world hasn't been warmer. The problem is the speed at which things are changing. We are inducing a sixth mass extinction event kind of by accident and we don't want to be the extinctee if I may coin...

We reached that goal in April 2020, and we’re certainly proud that our facilities, corporate emissions, and corporate travel don’t contribute carbon to the planet. We use 100 percent renewable electricity, and we’ve invested in the restoration of forests, wetlands, and grasslands to remove carbon naturally. However, all of this is just a starting point. We have an entirely different goal in mind. It’s kind of an audacious plan. By 2030 our whole carbon footprint — from manufacturing to transportation to end-of-life material recovery — will be nonexistent. All of Apple will be 100 percent carbon neutral. To do that, we’ll be using renewable energy and recycled materials throughout our supply chain. We’ll be restoring natural ecosystems around the world. And we’ll reuse as much as we can. While designing the world’s most innovative products, we’re also designing a sustainable manufacturing process. To really get to carbon zero while making products people all over the world love — a lot of people might say that’s impossible. We say it won’t be. Keep an eye on us and see.

The team says that a prolonged heatwave in the Siberian Arctic this year is “unequivocal evidence of climate change’”. The scientists say the record rise in temperatures there would be impossible without man-made global warming. The findings are of serious concern because here in the UK and the rest of Europe, the Arctic drives much of the weather systems we experience.

Will water become the habitat of the future? Visionary projects for a life with the tides are forging ahead worldwide. Experts forecast that by 2100, sea levels will be two meters higher than they are today. This could force 40 percent of the world’s population out of their homes, for example, in Mumbai, Tokyo, Guangzhou or Bangladesh. The US won’t be spared either. Miami, New Orleans and New York would also have to be evacuated. Entire city districts would be under water. Climate change would drastically alter our metropolitan areas. That's why ideas that originated in science fiction have now becoming reality. Floating and underwater buildings could become places of refuge. What sounds like a utopia is soon to become reality. The first pioneers are already living in floating neighborhoods. Could the South Pacific paradise of Tahiti also be saved in this way? This is still all tantalizing luxury. Visionary hotel operators offer rooms with an underwater view. Or dinner during which fish and marine life are a feature in floating restaurants. Many of these futuristic plans involve water. Will we be farming on the sea? Will the "SeaOrbiter” floating research station designed by Parisian architect Jacques Rougerie get underway soon? Or will we walk through seaports on floating boulevards? ------------------------------------------------------------------ DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Sandstorms are becoming more and more frequent, groundwater levels are sinking and palm trees are shrivelling up and dying. An age-old way of life is in danger. Halim Sbai says an oasis really is a paradise. But drought and desertification are now taking their toll on oases like M'hamid El Ghizlane in southeastern Morocco where he grew up. The survival of a whole region is at stake. Over hundreds of kilometers between the Anti-Atlas mountains and the Sahara desert there is one palm-fringed oasis after the next. Close to two million people live in these settlements. Up to now, many earned their living by harvesting dates from the palm trees. But this is proving more and more difficult. Decreasing and irregular rainfall is having a devastating impact on the trees and their yields. Halim Sbai is planting new palm trees and preserving as much precious water as he can in a bid to keep the oasis of M'hamid El Ghizlane and the region’s traditional way of life alive. Up to now, he has also been supplementing his income with earnings from tourism. Global warming could put an end to all this. ------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In the year 2019 we were still pumping out around 37 billion more. That’s 50% more than the year 2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago. And it’s not just CO2. We’re also pumping out growing volumes of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. Combining all of our greenhouse gases, we’re emitting 51 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents each year. And emissions keep rising – but they need to get down to 0!

Governments and policymakers must take urgent action. That action is guided by what science says about the impact of climate change on the Earth. This is how it’s calculated. This is Vilhelm Bjerknes. At the end of the 19th century he devised formulas which linked the flow of heat, water and air. 50 years later his ideas were the basis of the first computer model of the atmosphere. And modern-day weather forecasting was born Today’s climate models are the highly evolved descendants of that original, except the computers are some 25trn times faster. Here’s how it works Scientists divide the Earth’s atmosphere into a grid of hundreds of thousands of cells, in stacks like a skyscraper. The model used by the Met Office, Britain’s national weather service for example, uses stacks which are 85 cells high The models then calculate how energy, air and water vapour flow through each cell over a given time period. While weather forecasting takes a snapshot of the atmosphere at a given time and predicts what will happen over the next few days Climate models consider the atmosphere’s behaviour over years and years simulating either the world as it is or the world as it might be. For all their complexity, these models have limitations. This means the models often struggle to capture details like cloud cover. And clouds play a key role in climate. As greenhouse gases make the atmosphere warmer they change the amount of water vapour it can hold and how air rises and falls. That in turn changes the amount and character of cloud cover. Depending on where clouds form, they can either trap sunlight which warms the planet, or reflect it back into space, cooling it. And some processes which govern cloud formation work on a very small scale. Dozens of these models exist, run by teams all over the world Every few years the models are brought together fed standardised questions and then their results are compared. This helps scientists understand the strengths and weaknesses of different climate models, and improves them. Of course, it’s impossible to assess the models’ future projections. But what researchers can do is compare the success of models from previous decades. A recent report compared the models from the 1970s to the 2000s. The climate models are getting increasingly complicated capturing more aspects of the Earth. But there is one element that is impossible to model. And it is the biggest contributor to climate change. Instead, scientists take simplified results from these climate models and run them through economic models. In 2013 scientists used these models to examine the effect of different climate policies on the future temperature of the planet. The first looked at what would happen if there was continued large-scale use of coal. The second, if there was continued use of fossil fuels but some use of renewable energy. The third, if there was a much higher uptake of renewable energy. And the fourth if there was a lot of use of carbon-capture technology and more land to grow biofuels. Climate models don’t predict the future and they’re not perfect. There is a long way to go before they fully represent all of Earth’s intricate processes. But for now they are the only way that scientists have of understanding how damaging an increase in carbon dioxide will be for the planet. Ultimately, the solution to climate change won’t lie inside models but rather what humans choose to do with the information they provide	The Economist,Economist,Economist Films,Economist Videos,Politics,News,short-documentary,how scientists calculate climate change,science of climate change,climate change,global warming,climate,climate science,science,global climate change,misconceptions about climate change,global warming 101,science explained,global warming short film,climate crisis,climate change short film	25	News & Politics	PT7M20S	440	2d	hd	true		1	80706	1992	86	0	331

The population density of cities leads to inherent vulnerabilities to mass climate disasters: such as single point of failure transit systems and utilities built prior to today's environmental realities. At the same time the resources of cities offer tremendous potential for preparation and innovation. As a sociologist, Klinenberg brings insights on how neighborhood dynamics (what he calls "social infrastructure") can help individuals & communities prepare for extreme weather including flooding and heat waves. He discusses how cities can be wiser and think more long-term by planning traditional infrastructure projects which also enable such social infrastructure in their design. "Climate Change and the Future of Cities" was given on March 07, 02017 as part of The Long Now Foundation's “Conversations at The Interval” Salon Talks. These hour long talks are recorded live at The Interval, our bar, cafe, & museum in San Francisco.

One of the most frequent questions climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe gets is: “Is climate change going to kill us all in 10 years?” Sometimes, the timeframe is 11 or 12 years, but nonetheless, this questions stems from a misunderstanding of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which lays out how much we need to reduce pollution in order to avoid catastrophic climate change.

Be one of the first 200 people to sign up with this link and get 20% off your subscription with Brilliant.org! https://brilliant.org/OCC/ In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at what you can do about climate change using individual, personal, and collective actions. This video, however, is not a simple list of the best things a person can do to change their lifestyle and shrink their carbon footprint, instead I start by looking at the way in which we’ve globally become fixated on individual solutions to climate change. We envision ourselves more as consumers than as citizens. As a result carbon footprint related actions like flying less, zero waste, and recycling are prioritized over voting, protesting, and system change. This video is all about doing both personal things to lower your carbon footprint like driving less, but simultaneously acting collectively to create a system in which having a small carbon footprint is feasible for everyone. Structural change and individual change are both necessary to stop climate change.

For eons, nature has relied on photosynthesis as a big way to keep carbon dioxide levels from getting out of control. But as we have put more carbon into the air, we’ve also cut down many of the forests we need to suck that carbon up. So big tree-planting initiatives like #TeamTrees to the rescue, right? Actually, we need to think bigger. Here’s three ways trees really can help us solve climate change, from a guy who wants to plant a TRILLION trees, to how we might save the forests we’ve got, to scientists hacking biology to make trees even better.

CONTENT: Temperature Will Rise: Climate models predict that Earth’s global average temperate will rise in the future. For the next two decades warming of about 0.2° Celsius is projected. If we continue to emit as many, or more, greenhouse gases, this will cause more warming during the 21st Century than we saw in the 20th Century. During the 21st Century, various computer models predict that Earth’s average temperature will rise between 1.8° and 4.0° Celsius (3.2° and 7.2° F). The amount of predicted warming differs depending on the model emissions scenario (how much greenhouse gas emissions it assumes for the future). The amount of predicted warming also differs between different climate models. Climate change is predicted to impact regions differently. For example, temperature increases are expected to be greater on land than over oceans and greater at high latitudes than in the tropics and mid-latitudes. Changing Precipitation: Warmer average global temperature will cause a higher rate of evaporation, causing the water cycle to “speed up”. More water vapor in the atmosphere will lead to more precipitation. According to models, global average precipitation will most likely increase by about 3-5% with a minimum increase of at least 1% and a maximum increase of about 8%. Yet, changes in precipitation will not be evenly distributed. Some locations will get more snow, others will see less rain. Some places will have wetter winters and drier summers. Melting Snow and Ice: As the climate warms, snow and ice melt. The amount of summer melting of glaciers, ice sheets, and other snow and ice on land are predicted to be greater than the amount of winter precipitation. The amount of sea ice (frozen seawater) floating in the ocean in the Arctic and Antarctic is expected to decrease over the 21st Century too, although there is some uncertainty as to the amount of melt. Rising Sea Level: A warmer climate causes sea level to rise via two mechanisms: (1) melting glaciers and ice sheets (ice on land) add water to the oceans, raising sea level, and (2) ocean water expands as it warms, increasing its volume and thus also raising sea level. During the 20th Century, sea level rose about 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches). Thermal expansion and melting ice each contributed about half of the rise, though there is some uncertainty in the exact magnitude of the contribution from each source. By the year 2100, models predict sea level will rise between about 20 and 50 cm (8 to 20 inches) above late 20th Century levels. Thermal expansion of sea water is predicted to account for about 75% of future sea level rise according to most models. Acidic Ocean Water: Earth's oceans are predicted to act as a buffer against climate change by taking up some of the excess heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This is good news in the short run, but more problematic in the long run. Carbon dioxide combined with seawater forms weak carbonic acid. Scientists believe this process has reduced the pH of the oceans by about 0.1 pH since pre-industrial times. Further acidification of 0.14 to 0.35 pH is expected by the year 2100. More acidic ocean water may cause problems for marine organisms. Impacts on Ocean Currents: Large-scale ocean currents called thermohaline circulation, driven by differences in salinity and temperature, may also be disrupted as climate warms. Changes in precipitation patterns and the influx of fresh water into the oceans from melting ice can alter salinity. Changing salinity, along with rising water temperature, may disrupt the currents. In an extreme case, thermohaline circulation could be disrupted or even shut down in some parts of the ocean, which could have large effects on climate.

Subscribe to our channel here: https://goo.gl/31Q53F An investigation by Newsnight in conjunction with Greenpeace has found that the government agency, UK Export Finance (UKEF), has helped to finance oil and gas projects that, when completed, will emit 69 million tonnes of carbon a year. according to government estimates. That equates to nearly a sixth of the UK’s domestic estimated carbon emissions. This is despite a government commitment to cut down on carbon emissions. Boris Johnson has announced that the UK would no longer finance coal mining or coal-fired power plants abroad. Newsnight’s investigation found all of UKEF's current fossil fuel financing was for oil and gas projects, and not coal. It also found that - since 2010 - UKEF has financed £6bn of fossil fuel projects. Financing has been provided to some of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world. James Clayton investigates.

Sea temperatures in 2019 were the highest on record. Oceans are the clearest measure of climate change, since they absorb 90 per cent of the world's heat. Warmer seas mean more intense storms, droughts, floods and wildfires. The study is the latest warning on the climate crisis facing our planet. However, greenhouse gas emissions are still at record levels. Are we starting to tune out to the constant stream of bad news on the climate? If so, how should we change the conversation?

The scientists who work at this outpost in Antarctica are studying the effects of climate change -- under extreme conditions. Journalist Matthias Ebert traveled to the station to find out more about their research. The scientists are particularly concerned about the speed at which Antarctic ice is melting - and its impact on global sea levels. The researchers have also been studying a large colony of emperor penguins that lives near their facility -- to find out more about how these birds are adapting to climate change. Ebert reports on the daily lives of the scientists who work at the Neumayer Station, and how they cope with the extreme weather conditions, isolation, and cramped quarters. They've even managed to grow some of their own food in a greenhouse at the facility. Ebert documents the damaging effect that global warming is having on the Antarctic, and the risk that this poses for the rest of the world. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The third planet from the sun is currently the only astronomical object known to harbor intelligent life. For much of our planet's history, its existence has continued unhindered by human activity. Only toward the middle of the 20th century did the earth started to feel the negative effects of human activity. The earth’s climate has been changing at an alarming rate for the past one hundred years. The negative effects of global warming will destroy human life and prosperity. As a whole, we must alter the way we live our lives in order to combat climate change. Sounds impossible? Well, simply tweaking a few aspects of your daily routine could have a positive effect on the earth’s atmosphere. If everyone joins together to make a change, the whole world could benefit from it.

And it’s worth asking: Where did the past 10 years get us? The seven charts below begin to hint at an answer to that question. Some of the changes they document, like the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the number of billion dollar disasters that occur each year, illustrate how little we did to reduce emissions and how unprepared the world is to deal with the warming we’ve already locked in. Even though more people believe in human-caused climate change now than 10 years ago, a growing chasm in political partisanship makes it more difficult than ever for Congress to pass climate legislation. But by other measures, we might one day look back on the 2010s as a turning point in our civilization’s approach to climate change. The growth of renewable energy and rapid retirement of coal-burning power plants this decade illustrate that crucial changes to the world order are currently well underway." #TheDamageReport #JohnIadarola #TheYoungTurks	200102__DR01ClimateChangeDataBP,News,Politics,climate change 2010s,decade of climate change,climate change data,climate change studies,climate change research,climate change science,climate change charts,climate change,climate crisis,carbon emissions,co2 emission,greta thunberg,green new deal,environmentalism,fossil fuels,green energy,natural disasters,climate overtime,climate history,climate deniers,aoc,global warming,mass extinction	25	News & Politics	PT8M	480	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F_ZbU-PilWg/maxresdefault.jpg	1	30127	1691	47	0	643

Without me! | DW Documentary (climate change documentary)	Record heat, forest fires, drought — global warming is increasingly noticeable in Europe too. The climate crisis appears unavoidable. But most people are continuing to eat, fly and consume just as they always have. In Germany, many are talking about the need to protect the climate, but few are taking action. This report asks: can humanity still save itself? Dedicated climate activists are seeking to hold a mirror up to society through protests and blockades, resorting to drastic measures at times. Their protests may grab the headlines, but to what extent do they resonate with those attending the Cruise Days in Hamburg or the IAA motor show in Frankfurt? Then there’s always the question of how much can one person actually do to stop climate change, and how much is down to the politicians? And does banning things really help? One problem that stops effective action in Germany is the lack of public trust in politicians. In the eastern state of Thuringia, for example, citizens' initiatives were set up to protest the building of the ‘Suedlink' underground power line, designed to transport wind-generated energy from the north to supply areas in the south. It’s one of the key infrastructure projects in Germany’s planned switch to a low-carbon, nuclear-free economy. Residents along the route don’t want the landscape in their area being dug up for energy that wouldn’t benefit them personally. Clearly it’s not easy to introduce measures to stop climate change in a society with insufficient public trust and little sense of solidarity. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Climate change is happening now, and even world leaders meeting for climate talks at this year’s Cop25 know we aren’t doing enough to stop it. In fact, we’re going backwards. The UN says carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere are going up, and the earth is on track to warm by 3.2 degrees before the century is over.

Trees are burning up around the planet at an alarming rate and impacting the climate. Now a new effort to plant as many trees as possible has taken hold around the globe. But will it mitigate climate change? In California, 3 million acres have burned since 2017. And in Brazil, some 121,000 fires have burned since January — more than half in the Amazon rainforest. The fires have cost the planet millions of trees, one of the Earth’s best defenses against climate change. Now a movement around the globe is trying to replace trees lost to fire and deforestation for agriculture or grazing. In Ethiopia, the prime minister announced a new #GreenLegacy initiative that planted more than 353 million trees in 12 hours. Even YouTube stars are getting in on the act: More than 600 social media personalities recently raised over $16 million to plant trees worldwide. The effort was led by Jimmy Donaldson, a YouTube star who’s also known as MrBeast. Reforestation is also a big part of the Paris climate agreement, which the U.S. recently abandoned at the behest of President Donald Trump. But can planting billions and billions of trees really mitigate climate change? For that matter, is it even feasible? » Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision » Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic About CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

More than you might think. Follow us on Facebook for updates: http://fb.com/politicallyaweh Focusing on climate activism in South Africa, the final instalment of our "Climate Change in South Africa" mini-series unpacks how a new generation of youth activists follow in their parents’ footsteps in the struggle against what the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights has dubbed “climate apartheid: where the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger, and conflict, while the rest of the world is left to suffer.” This episode features interviews with environmental lawyer, Tatenda Muponde, youth activist, Ayakha Melithafa and Amnesty International Secretary-General, Kumi Naidoo, as well as on the ground reporting from the 2019 global climate strikes in Cape Town, South Africa.

"You have stolen my childhood and my dreams with your empty words," Thunberg said at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York. "You're failing us, but young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you," she added. Thunberg traveled to the U.S. by sailboat last month so she could appear at the summit. She and other youth activists led international climate strikes on Friday in an attempt to garner awareness ahead of the UN's meeting of political and business leaders.

Global emissions are reaching record levels and show no sign of peaking. The last four years were the four hottest on record, and winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen by 3°C since 1990. Sea levels are rising, coral reefs are dying, and we are starting to see the life-threatening impact of climate change on health, through air pollution, heatwaves and risks to food security. The impacts of climate change are being felt everywhere and are having very real consequences on people’s lives. Climate change is disrupting national economies, costing us dearly today and even more tomorrow. But there is a growing recognition that affordable, scalable solutions are available now that will enable us all to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The latest analysis shows that if we act now, we can reduce carbon emissions within 12 years and hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C and even, as asked by the latest science, to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Thankfully, we have the Paris Agreement – a visionary, viable, forward-looking policy framework that sets out exactly what needs to be done to stop climate disruption and reverse its impact. But the agreement itself is meaningless without ambitious action. UN Secretary-General António Guterres is calling on all leaders to come to New York on 23 September with concrete, realistic plans to enhance their nationally determined contributions by 2020, in line with reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent over the next decade, and to net zero emissions by 2050.	dpiavl,english,global issues,topics/issues,cas,cas2019,climate change,6088742229001	25	News & Politics	PT4M8S	248	2d	sd	true			1283848	11762	13107	0	4478

You have stolen my dreams and my childhood'	'You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,' climate activist Greta Thunberg has told world leaders at the 2019 UN climate action summit in New York. In an emotionally charged speech, she accused them of ignoring the science behind the climate crisis, saying: 'We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth - how dare you!'

But how much can trees really do to tackle global warming? See our research here: https://econ.st/32HXvXY Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy Summer 2019 - More than 38,000 fires raged across the Amazon. Fires that were man-made. Over the past 50 years almost 17% of the world’s largest rainforest has been cleared. And globally deforestation has almost doubled in just five years. Since the start of human civilisation it’s estimated that the number of trees around the world has fallen by almost half. Clearing forests increases carbon-dioxide levels but planting them could store away some of the carbon already in the atmosphere. This woman runs safaris in England. Guests are not only here to see wild animals - they’re here to see wild trees. Almost 20 years ago Isabella Tree—yes that is her real name-handed 1,400 hectares of Sussex farmland back to nature, by doing, well nothing. She thinks this is the best way to use the land to help tackle climate change. To stabilise the climate global carbon emissions need to drop to net zero by 2050. Simon Lewis is a professor of global change science. And there’s never been more global ambition to plant trees. In 2014, 51 countries pledged to plant over 3.5m square kilometres of forest by 2030 - an area slightly larger than India. The 2030 target looks likely to be met. But there’s a catch… Monoculture tree plantations like eucalyptus grow quickly but the trees are harvested every ten or so years releasing much of the carbon stored in the tree back into the atmosphere - which means that, according to some studies they’ll store only around one-fortieth of the carbon natural forests do over the long term. In fact, those pledges to plant millions of trees actually promise to store 26bn tonnes less carbon than they could. Sometimes the motives for planting forests are less green than they might appear. By 2020 Ireland ought to have cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 20% below 2005 levels. But at current rates it will have reduced them by only 5%. Planting forests might help Ireland avoid massive penalties for missing EU targets because the potential carbon these forests could store in the future can be counted as a carbon credit today. In the 1920s Ireland had the lowest forest cover in Europe at around 1%. That’s now risen to 11% and the government has set a target to cover 18% of the land with forest by 2046. And now local community groups are protesting against these monoculture tree plantations. They say they’re doing more harm than good. Tree-planting programmes invariably have an impact on the people living nearby. In east Africa one project is demonstrating what can be achieved when there’s genuine buy-in from the local communities. Green Ethiopia is a mixed-tree planting charity. The land is communally owned and co-operatives of local women receive benefits for planting trees which are protected from being harvested. Here conserving is just as important as planting. Green Ethiopia assesses whether the condition of the land is good enough to regenerate by itself. When it is—on about a third of the area the charity runs they leave it alone. Just like Isabella Tree, back in England. Monoculture plantations are often preferred because they make money. So some experts are looking to a future where carbon payments could create financial incentives for natural forests. Ultimately though, the trouble with trees tackling climate change is space For more from Economist Films visit: http://films.economist.com/ Check out The Economist’s full video catalogue: http://econ.st/20IehQk Like The Economist on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomist/ Follow The Economist on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theeconomist Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist/ Follow us on Medium: https://medium.com/@the_economist	The Economist,Economist,Economist Films,Economist Videos,News,short-documentary,climate change,global warming,global warming short film,climate,environment,greenhouse gases,climate change news,climate crisis,climate change solutions,planting trees,trees	25	News & Politics	PT9M45S	585	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EXkbdELr4EQ/maxresdefault.jpg	1	670482	16084	1131	0	2122

And in Switzerland, temperature rises are twice the global mean. (Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) In fact, if nothing is done to tackle climate change, all the glaciers in the Alps could vanish by the end of the century. A move to make Switzerland carbon neutral by 2050 has just gathered enough signatures to go to a referendum, but who's coming up with solutions? All this year we have travelled to the far corners of the earth.This week we are focusing on the change our planet is going through - the threat to our future existence,but also what's being done to combat the threat.

Climate change is arguably the greatest challenge of our time. Human activity has already warmed the planet by one degree Celsius relative to pre-industrial times, and we are feeling the effects through record heat waves, droughts, wildfires and flooding. If we continue to burn fossil fuels at the current rate, the planet will reach two degrees of warming by 2050 - the threshold that many scientists have identified as a dangerous tipping point. What is the science behind these projections? Join climate scientist expert Michael Mann to learn about the basic scientific principles behind climate change and global warming. We need to understand the science in order to solve the broader environmental, societal and economic changes that climate change is bringing. By the end of this course, you will: -Develop a deep scientific understanding of HOW the climate system has been changing; -Articulate WHY the climate system is changing; -Understand the nature of these changes; -Develop a systems thinking approach to analyzing the impacts of climate change on both natural and human systems.	edX,edx.org,free online courses,free courses online,free courses,free classes,online classes,online courses free,online college courses,online college classes,free online classes,education,free education,online education,massive open online course,MOOC,MOOC courses,online learning,lifelong learning,free online learning,free university courses,MIT online courses,distance learning,distance education,certificates,free college courses,Harvard,MIT	27	Education	PT2M15S	135	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8vP00TP6-p0/maxresdefault.jpg	1	7030	87	34	0	4
