    "# Warm-up challenges for week 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen how to use scikit-learn, statsmodels and LIME to do modelling, it's time for you to  apply this knowledge. This week has three preparatory challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each challenge has two components:\n",
    "1. **Programming and interpretation**\n",
    "3. **Reflection**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some important notes for the challenges:**\n",
    "1. These challenges are a warming up, and help you get ready for class. Make sure to give them a try on all of them. \n",
    "2. If you get an error message, try to troubleshoot it (using Google often helps). If all else fails, go to the next challenge (but make sure to give it a try).\n",
    "3. These challenges are ungraded, yet they help you prepare for the graded challenges in the portfolio. If you want to be efficient, have a look at what you need to do for the upcoming graded challenges and see how to combine the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Facing issues? \n",
    "\n",
    "We are constantly monitoring the issues on the GitHub to help you out. Don't hesitate to log an issue there, explaining well what the problem is, showing the code you are using, and the error message you may be receiving. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** We are only monitoring the repository in weekdays, from 9.30 to 17.00. Issues logged after this time will most likely be answered the next day. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to combine code *and* markdown to answer all questions. Mention specifically the question (and question number) and the answer in markdown, relating to the code and the output of the code. For the graded challenges, failing to do so will impact the grade, as we will not be able to see whether you answered the question.\n",
    "2. For every line of code, please include a cell in MarkDown explaining what the code is expected to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Scenario - valid for Challenges 1, 2 and 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In DA5 and 6, we will work with a simulated dataset from an online store that created a set of campaigns. This dataset will be used to predict whether someone made purchases, or not (i.e., ```purchase``` ) and, if so, how much they spent (i.e.,```order_euros```). \n",
    "\n",
    "These predictions will be later used for targeting users. For example, the marketing manager wants to:\n",
    "* Identify users that have a high likelihood of making a purchase so she can run targeted advertising campaigns towards these users as a way to increase their awareness of the store.\n",
    "* Identify users that are likely to spend more than 100 euros on the store, and give them discounts that other users would not receive. \n",
    "\n",
    "These predictions will be made about the dependent variables (or targets): ```purchase``` and ```order_euros```. Your independent variables (or features) will be relevant characteristics available on (or created from) the datasets as outlined in Challenge 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find three files in this folder (starting with da5-6):\n",
    "* ```da56_orders.csv.gz``` (or ```da56_orders.pkl.gz``` for a pickle version). This file contains a list of orders made on an online store. It contains the session_id that made the order, whether there was a purchase, and how many euros were spent in that order.\n",
    "* ```da56_sessions.csv.gz``` (or ```da56_sessions.pkl.gz``` for a pickle version). This file contains a list of online sessions in the website. For each session, it contains the details of the browser that visited the site (user_agent), when the visit started, what the referral was, and if the referral was part of a paid campaign. If a user had a profile when doing the purchase, this file will also contain their user id.\n",
    "* ```da56_users.jsonl```. This file contains a list of registered users on the website, their name, when they created their profile, their age, the referral that they followed when creating their profile, and whether they are part of an exclusive club of preferential clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first challenge, you will **load, inspeact, clean and visualize** your own dataset, and:\n",
    "1. Load and inspect each file using the steps you learned in the course\n",
    "2. Select which files and columns you will use for the challenge \n",
    "3. Transform the files into the appropriate format and merge them appropriately\n",
    "4. Review the dataset created through merging, and remove personally identifiable data\n",
    "5. Identify at one key independent variable and at least three control variables that should influence the dependent variables (```purchase``` and ```order_euros```), and perform any additional data cleaning steps required to create or transform these variables so they can be used for statistical testing and machine learning.\n",
    "6. Provide descriptive statistics for all the relevant dependent, independent and control variables\n",
    "7. Create univariate charts for each dependent, independent and control variable, and at least one chart with an interesting bivariate relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips:** \n",
    "* You are free to decide which files you find interesting to work with, but for the challenge to work properly there are at least two files that **have** to be used so you can create a meaningful dataset.\n",
    "* If you decide to use the ```da56_users``` dataset, you may end up with several missing values (for users that entered the website but did not have a profile, or made the purchase checking out as guest). You can decide whether to fill these missing values and keep the cases, if appropriate, or simply to work with a smaller dataset (only for registered users). Both ways are fine but, whatever you do, make sure to explain what you are doing and justify your choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "In sections 1 and 2 of their article, Tràmer et al. (2017) discuss how unfair treatments can arise from irresponsible data usage, and provide a few examples. You are now working with digital trace data from a (fictitious) online store, and will later create models that will be used to target campaigns or give discounts to consumers. Please briefly discuss how this may create the risk for unfair treatment (and indicate specifically what that unfair treament would be, and why). Moving one step further, look at the variables in the original datasets (da56_orders, da56_sessions and da56_users). Select one that you believe that has the most potential for creating risks of unfair treatment, and explain why."
