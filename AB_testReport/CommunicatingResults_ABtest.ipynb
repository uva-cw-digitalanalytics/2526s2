    "* What is the dataset about? How does it relate to the business challenge?\n",
    "* What is the source of the data? \n",
    "    * You can for example think of Google Analytics or data collected through social media (when e.g., tracking effectiveness of campaigns)\n",

This means that you should not just do a *df.describe()*  to communicate descriptive statistics in a dataset that contains a lot of irrelevant columns and expect the reader to figure out by her or himself what is relevant. You should instead only show to the reader what is relevant, and explain why.\n",

This means that when ANOVAs or T-Tests are used (as statistical testing), and equivalent OLS/Linear Regression Model (in scikit-learn) needs to be used to make predictions. All tests need to be done in Python, using statsmodels and/or scikit-learn."
