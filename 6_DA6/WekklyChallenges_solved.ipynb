    "# Challenges for week 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen how to use scikit-learn, statsmodels and LIME to do modelling, it's time for you to  apply this knowledge. This week has three challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each challenge has three components:\n",
    "1. **Programming**: Applying one of the programming or data analysis steps in Python you learned in the tutorial\n",
    "2. **Interpretation**: Explaining what you are doing and interpreting the results of the data analysis in MarkDown \n",
    "3. **Reflection**: Connecting these concepts with the literature of the week in a short reflection (*max 300 words*)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some important notes for the challenges:**\n",
    "1. These challenges are a warming up, and help you get ready for class. Make sure to give them a try on all of them. If you get an error message, try to troubleshoot it (using Google often helps). If all else fails, go to the next challenge (but make sure to hand it in).\n",
    "2. While we of course like when you get all the answers right, the important thing is to exercise and apply the knowledge. So we will still accept challenges that may not be complete, as long as we see enough effort *for each challenge*. The rubric (see Canvas) reflects this.\n",
    "3. Delivering the challenge on time on Canvas assignment is critical, as it helps also prepare for the DA live session. Check on Canvas how to hand it in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Facing issues? \n",
    "\n",
    "We are constantly monitoring the issues on the GitHub to help you out. Don't hesitate to log an issue there, explaining well what the problem is, showing the code you are using, and the error message you may be receiving. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** We are only monitoring the repository in weekdays, from 9.30 to 17.00. Issues logged after this time will most likely be answered the next day. This means you should not wait for our response before submitting a challenge :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Scenario - valid for Challenges 1, 2 and 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In DA5 and 6, we will work with a simulated dataset from an online store that created a set of campaigns. This dataset will be used to predict whether someone has made purchases, or not (i.e., ```purchase``` ) and, if so, how much they have spent (i.e.,```order_euros```). \n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario:\n",
    "Our webshop has launched new campaigns to increase sales (as binary, ```purchase```) and revenue (```order_euros```). We are now only interested in sales (i.e., binary DV).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in two campaigns (indicated in column ```type_campaign```):\n",
    "* The CPC campaign running on Facebook and Google\n",
    "* The influencer campaign running on Instagram and Facebook\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to know if each campaign led to an increase in sales compared to the other campaigns (i.e., any traffic source that is not set as CPC or influencer).\n",
    "\n",
    "These predictions will be made about the dependent variable (or target): ```purchase```. Your independent variables (or features) will be relevant characteristics available on (or created from) the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challange, we focus on modelling and evaluating machine learning models. Therefore, we have prepared a merged dataset with all variables necessary. You can find it in the Github folder; it is called ```da6_fulldata.csv.gz``` (for csv file) or ```da6_fulldata.pkl.gz``` (fir pickle file). It contains information about:\n",
    "* sessions. Columns ```session_id```, ```session_timestamp```, ```user_agent```, ```referral```, ```type_campaign``` tell us  the details of the browser that visited the site (user_agent), when the visit started, what the referral was, and what campaign the referral came from.\n",
    "* orders. Columns ```order_euros``` and ```purchase``` include information if a user made a purchase and how much they spent.\n",
    "* users. Columns ```user_id```, ```reg_name```, ```registration_date```, ```initial_referrer```, ```preferential_client``` and ```age``` for registered users tell us their name, when they created their profile, their age, the referral that they followed when creating their profile, and whether they are part of an exclusive club of preferential clients\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: this is a different dataset than you used last week. This dataset is already merged and has additional information about campaigns the webshop is running on different sites. The dataset does not have all the variables you need. You will have to crate them in this challenge.* \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first challenge, you need to:\n",
    "* Propose which control variables are relevant to be included in the model.\n",
    "* Create the necessary features for different campaigns based on the column ```type_campaign``` (this column includes information about what kind of camapign someone has seen. You can use this information to create the necessary variables for identifying users coming from the CPC or infleuncer campaign) and for your control variables (that you chose in step 1).\n",
    "* Create two models for statistical testing (with **statsmodels**). One only with the campaign information (cpc and infleuncer), and a second model with at least one additional independent or control variable. It can be one of the variables about the session or user. Sales, as a binary variable should be your DV.\n",
    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT: Don't forget to split your data in train / test datasets, and use only the train dataset here, as done also in the DA6 tutorial.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Justify your choice (in MarkDown) for the additional variable for the second model\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a **technical** and a **business** interpretation for the creation of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The **technical** interpretation should explain the results of the models and technical comparison of the model (which model works better).\n",
    "* The **business** summary should explain which control variable(s) you chose and why, which model you choose and what the results of the model tell us about each of the campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Markdown formatting to make the summary clear and visually appealing, and constantly refer to the output of the code to substantiate your claims. If needed, you can combine the code with the summary (e.g., start the summary in markdown, run the relevant code in the next cell, and interpret the output using MarkDown in the next cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "Finn & Wadhwa (2014) argue that digital analytic practices such as the example case in this week's challanges have ethical impacts including identifiability, inequality, a chilling effect, the objectification, exploitation and manipulation of consumers as well as information asymmetries. For the reflection, choose one of the impacts and reflect to what extent such a campaign evaluation and performance prediction as conducted in this challange may have such an impact. Provide specific examples to link the ethical impact to the case."

For the reflection, select one of the questions (except question 2 discussed in challenge 2) and apply it to the case of this week (a company collects digital trace data to analyse campaign effectiveness). Please motivate your response with specific issues about the case."
